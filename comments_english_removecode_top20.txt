I really like the phrase that it breaks the perception that it is a cosmetics store and makes you yourself ㅠㅠ
When I first saw this commercial on TV, I got goosebumps. I was a foreigner who felt it was the best CF in Korea.. The ad line is wow~~~ It's art... Fly Olive ^^
I got my eyebrow tattoos from MeijiU, and when I asked why it was so natural, it said it was their own brand pigment.
I think Olive Young is really good at advertising. Every time it appears on TV, I keep staring at it in amazement.
I didn't know it, but Meiji You is famous for not re-taking the course.
It will be fun if it comes out once in All Eve Young Walkman
Meiji You's class atmosphere is so good. Government subsidy is provided and it's a bummer. It's my life's academy!
Olive young is awesome~!!
This time, my friend and I took semi-permanent classes at Meiji U, and I can see why it's famous ㅠ Everyone has Meiji U.
If I say it's incomplete while writing a model, I...
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I had a hairline treatment at Meiji You last time, and there is no better place than this place,,,, I recommend this place! Extremely recommended!
Can you tell what lip the person in 6 seconds is wearing? Or even a brand... TT
I really like this ad "How wonderful it is that we are all born unfinished." this is so good
The balloon drip was a bit...
You can't keep up with the trends of the times.
The unnie in 6 seconds has pretty lips..
If you know the name of the actor (thumbnail) in 6-7 seconds, please comment.
Try Olive Young's part-time job
Please give me the name of boogeum ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
What is the name of the model wearing green sportswear in 1 second?
0:03 The clothes are fine...what kind of pants would suit you?
I'm sorry for the man with the bag ^^
What is the name of the music in the ad?
This commercial feels like a broadcast commercial that just moved on to OnStyle CJ in the past... It was around the early to mid 2000s...
I heard from MeijiU for taking eyelash treatment, but the government is also subsidizing it ㅋㅋ The money is solid
Is it Han Seong-joo, the female model at the end?
The female model who appears in the 6th second is Kim Ah-hyun.
My name is Olive...? Fly... Olive...? I didn't want to make it like this..?
0:07 Someone who can give me some clothes information is pretty.
I really miss this ad
what's the song title??
Anyone know the song title
I worked hard hahahaha boycotted boycott, and finally made a big picture .. what kind of people shouldn't buy Japanese stuff like this hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Defcon team did a good job
I learned everything semi-permanently at Meiji U. No repeat classes.
Anyone narrating? I wonder about your voice
I'm arguing
I thought they would be uncomfortable seeing the advertisement, so I searched to see it.
I did it anyway
so the song title
???: Akermu~ Mr. Acher~
0:13 Like Ryu Seung-beom
Anyone know who the thumbnail is
Thumbnail jenine line
The name of the model who comes out in a tie-dye tee in 6 seconds,,,,,,,,I see my ideal type here.
I am olive
lol
It's been a while hyung, let me open an account
Because it was unfinished, did you close the door by ignoring the man being stabbed?
Oh come early 17th!
I will be upset
0:28 Who are you?
Is this a job advertisement?
I'm sorry, but can't we talk about that YouTube?
this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2IpYd6Pu3s&feature=youtu.be Everyone came here because they were curious about what the commercials were?
00:06 Came in after seeing this person
But is it incomplete without makeup? Am I better with makeup? Ads don't keep up with the times, and there's not a single word about it.
Pathetic advertisement.. I don't want to see it anymore on TV and YouTube..
olives
Izzy Bizu White Tiger
I came to see the extended version, but there were few.. Please select the words again for the TV version. Aren't you crazy? We are all unfinished. Who the hell made the copy? Why did we change the word "possible" to incomplete.. It's ridiculous.. The more I hear it the more angry I get
I'm really mad at this ad To say "We are all born unfinished" is a cosmetic ad... What's wrong with a person who doesn't wear makeup? It cannot be completed without makeup.
=========End of Crawling===========
Thanks for the useful information~
The makeup looks a bit excessive, but all the actors in the cast are unique and attractive. I wish I could know your name as well.
It's so nice to have the Meiji You night class haha ​​I learned a lot from the director!!
I also went for eyelash surgery because the comments and reviews were very good, and I am very satisfied!! I'm only going to go here.
In the semi-permanent academy, Meiji You seems to be the best, so I learned a lot and received positive energy.
I got my eyebrow tattoos from MeijiU, and when I asked why it was so natural, it said it was their own brand pigment.
I had my eyelashes done at MeijiU, but this is the first time I've been to such a friendly place hehe I was so happy!
I didn't know it, but Meiji You is famous for not re-taking the course.
I had a hairline treatment at Meiji You last time, and there is no better place than this place,,,, I recommend this place! Extremely recommended!
If you are curious about a place that does a good hairline, go to Meiji You!! Please do a good job overall!! The manager is also kind.
This time, my friend and I took semi-permanent classes at Meiji U, and I can see why it's famous ㅠ Everyone has Meiji U.

How much charm did you exude with just one sweet home, so you're already a model for the all-young sale...? I will be successful
It's not Kim Min-hee, but she has only Kim Min-hee's flair .. Isn't it the existence we've been waiting for ... !!
I keep coming out, but the smile is so pretty, I came in...
I am so looking forward to the sale
It's already been called the All-Young Sale! 👨🏻‍👨‍👧👧
In the semi-permanent academy, Meiji You seems to be the best, so I learned a lot and received positive energy.
I think I'm going to go crazy when I'm worried.
I'm really attracted to what it is... Why are you so pretty?
All Young Sale was held 4 times a year haha ​​good
I went to MeijiU for lip treatment, and they recommended a color to match my skin tone. I really like it.
I started a business after taking classes at MeijiU in Gangnam, and the follow-up management is clear! It's best to manage it for free for 100 days.
If you are worried, John Yeboss ㅠㅠ It looks like you chose the model very well ><
Lee Dong-guk's daughter, Lee Jae-shi? It's that person ㅠㅠ The atmosphere is so pretty✨
If her sister told her to do it, she should.


..I can make it empty for my sister
Come! Young! Three! Day! Exciting feeling~All Young Sale~Lalalalala~
Meiji You's class atmosphere is so good. Government subsidy is provided and it's a bummer. It's my life's academy!
I didn't know it, but Meiji You is famous for not re-taking the course.
GoMinSi make me wanna to shop at Olive young while in reality I’m thousand kilometres away from South Korea.
I got my eyebrow tattoos from MeijiU, and when I asked why it was so natural, it said it was their own brand pigment.
You're really pretty when you're worried
It's coming soon,,,, that's awesome
I'm worried, I can't take my eyes off of you, see you at the All Young Sale!!
❤️❤️
If you swear every day at Sweet Home and smile sweetly like this... It hurts my heart...
This is Minshi unnie!!!!😍
This time, my friend and I took semi-permanent classes at Meiji U, and I can see why it's famous ㅠ Everyone has Meiji U.
I had a hairline treatment at Meiji You last time, and there is no better place than this place,,,, I recommend this place! Extremely recommended!
Go Go!!!♡
Isn't it perfect with Big Olyoung?
Oh, I don't know who it is, but she's pretty...
Do you know Gangnam Meiji U? I'm afraid I'll be a regular here.
Chegoda 🥰
I miss the experience team 😭
After all, she's pretty. A metaphor... Is the metaphor alive..?
When I opened my eyes, an advertisement came in and I was looking at a troubled poem
It's so sweet.. ^^
اهخخ تجنن💋💋💖
No, it's a dog
Hall I just had something to buy, yeah
Momentum Lee Dong-guk's first daughter haha
Mr. Minsi💓💓
Sweet Home!!
I heard from MeijiU for taking eyelash treatment, but the government is also subsidizing it ㅋㅋ The money is solid
You have a very natural charm when you are worried
Are you an idol? Are you a movie actor? Are you a talent?
👍
I learned everything semi-permanently at Meiji U. No repeat classes.
The video is boring compared to the actors.
Something like Kim Min-hee... so pretty
Hyo-ri Lee + Min-hee Kim + Hyo-rin Min + Yoon-hee Jo are all visible..
From tomorrow on!
Ah, I need to hear it.
Congratulations, this is my first love
The moment I saw it in the elevator, I thought it was Jessie... (Lee Dong-guk's daughter) Isn't there something similar???
Tomorrow is ...🤭
I came in because I look like Lee Hyori...
Minsi unnie is pretty

Minsi Minsi🙄🌷
He's in that video of everyday life in a mental hospital, right?
Somehow, the background is like gold, my bastard.
So what should a man buy?
The main character from the movie witch. Are you friends?
1 day 1 worry
Come see me when I'm worried
What's happening.....
sister.......
tttttt
is dead
=========End of Crawling===========
I'm really rich with hair, so I've always been concerned that it's dark when I wear short-sleeved shorts every summer, but I really like the ranking of hair removal products. Seeing this made me want to give it a try. All of the hair removal products here are so easy and neat... I really love all Alain Magic that makes me want to buy them all ️
Hair removal is a concern for all women. Thank you for introducing hair removal products as well!! Personally, although performance is performance, I value less irritation to the skin, so it is very helpful to catch this point and introduce good products. As a reference, I want to spend this summer cool with smooth skin.
Huh, it's a pleasure to do hair removal,,,,,It's summer, so I really felt the need for hair removal, but it takes a long time to do it and there are a lot of inconveniences. I'm so glad it's coming haha ​​I'm going to go this summer and have to prepare!
Wow, the algorithm did what the algorithm did.. I don't have any experience with hair removal yet, but now that summer is over, what do I do with my armpit hair.. To see a video like this come out while I was doing it ㅠㅠㅠㅠ This is fate. ! Grateful Olive Young ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I've been concerned about hair removal since last year, but I couldn't do it because I ran out of time... So I desperately wanted to do it this time. It was so good to know the types and how to use this video in a useful way. Especially the shea butter epilator made me so attracted. When I have time, I will definitely visit Olive Young!!
Wow, a real summer essential hair removal product ... In the real summer, when I wear short-sleeved shorts, I can see all the hairs in between, so I was really worried. There were a lot of failures, but I really like it ㅠㅠ I will use it as an example when I buy it later.
The real video of the All Alain Guide is so fun. The chemistry of the performers is so good that the more you watch it, the more you fall in love with it.

It's a really smart statement hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

I don't know why my hair keeps growing ㅠㅠ I've been thinking about living with a furry coat, but to protect other people's eyes, I'm just brushing my hair in the shower.

If you use wax, the roots will be pulled out, so I think the growth rate will be slower, so I want to try it.
As summer approaches, I have to expose my legs, and there are many inconveniences when removing hair. ㅠㅠ
Still, I was looking for a hair removal product to use this summer, and you're recommending it like this!!!!! You used it in the video, showed it to me, and gave me a recommendation, so I think I got some good information! And thank you for recommending really good products for recommending soothing products to use after hair removal.
The hair removal worries that come back every summer I don't know what's good, so I used the same product every time. The products in the video look really good! Especially wax!! I will use it as a recommended item for olive young this summer.
Really All Young is always full of honey items.
Now I feel like I'm the kind of person who can't live without All Young, but I think it's great because there are many products that women can use well.
There's nothing Olive Young doesn't have. I've been feeling the need for hair removal these days, but after seeing this recommended video, it's fun to think about what might be better for me. I was thinking about doing hair removal for the first time.
There are no reviews for hair removal cream on Olive Young Channel, so I was looking for reviews recommended by other YouTubers, but it came out just in time. This is a review of Olive Young that you can trust and listen to. If you are going to buy a product from Olive Young, I think it is very good to read the Olive Young channel reviews and buy it ♡♡♡ You are the person I know best~~~ Please give me good information next time.
If you do not want your skin to feel rough due to the hair after hair removal, I recommend wax/strip > cream > razor in the order~~ I used the hair removal cream shown in the video quite well ^_^
It's my mom series!! The real Olive Young is people who know what a timely item is. Because of the hot weather these days, I was thinking that it was time to start hair removal. I need to get my hair removed and get out of long pants! Now it seems that the time has come for me to start hair removal in earnest, but all the products really look good. It was too cumbersome to always soap and wash the leg hair before shaving it with a razor, so there were many cases where I passed the soaping and just shaved it off. I think the fact that you can apply soap and replace the blade separately is a really smart product!
I always used an eyebrow knife to remove my hair ㅠㅠ This video is so useful Thank you
I'm so glad that you introduced each type of tower!!
The bald-headed one is going to wipe away his tears here ㅡㅜㅜㅜㅜTTTT I'm still a student, so I don't know much about hair removal, but I'm learning well ️️ Olive young Howl for summer I'll have to run right away Kyaaaaa
I have a lot of hair on my legs, so I'm reluctant to wear a school uniform skirt, and I only wear long pants in the summer.
I really hate summer ㅠㅠ Hairy people shed tears...
Hair removal was painful and annoying, so I put it off, but with Olive Young hair removal products, I'm not afraid!!
I think All Young hair removal products are great because they allow perfect hair removal and soothing together.
A must-have item for summer. Thank you for recommending the top 5 Olive Young ㅠㅠ The price of the shea butter epilator is so good. I'm going to buy Olive Young right now!!!
I was very worried about the arms, calves, and hair when wearing school uniforms, but I'm so glad I found this video..
Hair removal cream is a must in summer!! I was stressed, but thank you for recommending a good product!!!
The weather is getting hotter, but I have a lot of hair on my arms and legs, so I always shaved with a razor, but shaving with a razor grows so fast that I was looking into this and that, so I really like this video. I need to run Olive Young
I came in to try hair removal with a hair removal cream for the first time, but thank you for organizing it like this ㅜㅜ I'm going to run all the way to the door tomorrow ️!
Thank you so much for putting this together and showing me the top 5 great products in detail!!! From a young age until last year, I had almost no hair on my arms and legs. It's so thin that it's hard to see even if it's real, but it's so thin and weak that people around you wondered why you don't have hair on your arms and legs. But since I have very little hair, I bought a supplement that said eating it would make it thicker, and I've been taking it for half a year, but the hair I've been told to get bigger is the same, and the hair on my arms and legs is thick and long hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ..

I was really very, very upset. So I clumsily shaved off the hair on my arm a few times with an eyebrow knife, and the hair got longer..heh.heh.... So I don't want to leave it like this anymore. Found the video!! It melts the hair like that and removes it neatly with a patch containing soothing ingredients, so you don't have to worry about the hair getting thicker or longer. thank you :)
I am interested in men's hair removal cream. Thank you for comparing various products and uploading them~ I think I will have to clean up before going to the swimming pool~^^
Washing products are highly recommended!!

What is Olive Young?
I've always been worried about hair removal in the summer, but thank you for letting me know about each type. I'll have to go all-young over the weekend and get rid of my hair removal products.
It's hard to ask about hair removal, I couldn't ask anywhere, but I really like it. The video is very useful. I'll do my hair removal for the first time in the summer. There are too many kills in the video. Another legend !
I was thinking about a hair removal cream, but I couldn't find a place to look for it. Thank you for organizing the number one selling products like this.
A regular razor stings, but it's chic. Sugar wax and
P.s Body Nature Hair Removal Cream is also good, but how good is the first place?
Even though I'm a woman, I was so stressed because my hair was spitting out more than other friends. I was worried about the start of school soon, but I didn't know which product would be good, so I couldn't even buy a hair removal product ㅠㅠ But Olive Young is reviewing hair removal products this time.. I really love you Olive Young!!
Among the products in the video, I really enjoyed using the razor, but I didn't know there were so many other products besides the razor. In particular, I want to try the beauty formula?
Wow, I'm rich in hair, so I kept wearing a coat over my summer clothes, but now it's getting hotter, so I was worried.
Strips and creams are items I've been constantly buying, so I'm going to have to buy a razor this time!!! I always avoid hair removal products from other places because it always stings, but these are the only all-young products I use ㅜㅜㅠㅠ I want to try all 5 of these products because I believe in Gwanggwang so much.
Ugh, I was worried about the hair I see every summer, but I think it's a very good product. Thank you for the recommendation.
Why didn't I know that there were products related to hair removal while going to Olive Young??? I am so craving for hair removal cream ㅁ I need to go to Olive Young and get it right now
I'm on the go right now

No, looking a little more, I need to get aloe vera gel together to soothe my skin ️️️️️
I was under a lot of stress because of my hair, but I didn't know there were so many honey items in All Young. Thanks to you, my bankbook is empty today too... ㅠㅠ
This is a waxer Each hair removal product has its pros and cons, so you have to use it properly.
I have a lot of hair on my body, so I was always stressed. Even when I was wearing a school uniform, my friends talked about it. So I think about hair removal every summer and I was always looking for it. Thank you so much for letting me know about this product.
I was always worried about how to remove my hair because I have a lot of hair, but thank you for reviewing each part properly.
I have long and a lot of hair on my limbs, so I wanted to try hair removal, but I couldn't because I was afraid of hair removal, but I was prepared to do it this summer.
It was summer, so I needed hair removal tools TTTT It's great to have Olive Young. Also All Young
It's still summer, so I was going to buy hair removal products, but the recommended video is perfect!! thank you
I watched Olive Young's video for the first time, everyone is fun and the explanations are easy to understand! subscribe and go
I've never tried a hair removal cream, but it's so interesting that I want to buy it!
Every time I pluck my hair, it hurts so much and it's stressful, so no matter how much I looked for good products, I was upset that I couldn't find it.
I have hair, but it seems to get colored every time I push it, so I was looking for a better one. Seriously, if I remove my hair with this one, I think I will be able to remove it without worries!!♡♡Thank you for the good content!!!
Even though I'm a woman, I have more hair than men, so I always use a razor, but the blades wear out quickly.. In the summer, it's annoying to shave almost every day, and if I don't, I'm really stressed because I fear that my friends will make fun of me. You think I'm flying... I'm just praying that this summer passes safely ㅜㅜ
I have a lot of hair on my body ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Thank you for recommending a good product ㅠㅠ I will go with smooth limbs this summer with those products >▽<
Thank you for the good product recommendation ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I will definitely try it!!
I used the Allha chic intuition epilator last year, but as soon as I saw this, I remembered this, so I went to the All Young app and bought it. Even now, it's almost 50% off. I really like this. Above all, I'm worried about rusting me if I use the epilator. is still scary, and I think I'll try the hair removal cream you recommended this year.
Besides the one in the video, I really like Olive Young's Philly Milly epilator.. The price is really cheap and it's convenient because it can be done with only water ㅜㅜ I'm using that and the second one!
Personally, I do not recommend Beauty Formula Shea Butter Hair Removal Cream for people with sensitive skin. I tried it, but it was a bit stinging and looked like red spots. Also, the hair removal power is not good, so in the end I shave it again with a razor. I used the hair removal cream on my arms and legs once, and it shrunk by two-thirds.. The amount is small compared to the price. Still, it's a waste to throw it away, so I'm going to try using it for armpit hair removal.
If you do not know about self-waxing, hair removal is rather difficult, your skin is damaged, and you suffer from ingrown hair. You can learn how not to irritate your skin by watching the video, and although it is expensive, if you do it at a waxing shop, they take good care of it. I take care of my chin, beard, legs, and armpits, and sometimes I go to the store to get a Brazilian if I want it.
The theme is hair removal, which is necessary for lighter clothes in warmer weather. This is a topic for me! Hahaha Hair! I can't miss it, so I'll try this event once. The first hair removal razor I've seen looks like a really smart product! But I shaved my legs with a razor, and my legs were red and swollen and it just stinged. It looks like a really good product, but the razor itself doesn't fit, so it's a pity that I won't be able to use it. And when I saw the wax strip, wow! It's okay, I felt like my whole body was tingling. What a noble sacrifice! Hahaha But Yoonstar said that it doesn't hurt as much as I thought, so I'm a little curious about the product! And hair removal cream...!! This is really a product for me...! To say that protein-dissolving products do not have a bad effect on the skin, I really sympathize with the saying that it is a product with the technology of the 21st century.
Chick is using it very well!! It's really easy!! Strips and wax work great, but I hate pain... So I'll have to try a hair removal cream later. Aromatica Vera Gel is the best for soothing hair removal even if it is not soothing.
I have to wear a skirt to the interview, so I have to shave my legs, but this is a helpful video...^^ Thank you.
I didn't know there were so many shaving products! I'm using the chic Intuition Shea Butter razor, and it's really good. I have a lot of hair, but it's very thin.
It's really smooth the moment you put it on ^^ It's so comfortable that you can just rub it while taking a shower because there's soap hanging around it.
I think there was also a refill! So I have been using it for a long time.
I've only tried pushing wax strips and waxing.. I've never done anything like this before, wow ㅠㅠ but I'm so scared hahahaha
I've seen other hair removal products, but I didn't know they even had wax!! It was difficult because there was a lot of skin practice and Muslim cloth left, but the next time I hear about Olive Young, I want to buy a wax and try it.
I saw it by chance.
I'm a woman and I have a lot of hair.
I was worried about what to do
Thank you for reviewing it yourself.
Olive young also read my mind,,,️️
I'm so curious about nair apple sugar wax ㅠㅠ It's the first time I've seen it, but it's sold well, so I really want to try it. Aloe gel is also selling well, so I'll have to buy one hehe It's summer now, so it's just the season for hair removal .. Olive young is also full of sense
Heh, I was really stressed out because of my hair ㅜㅜ I must try that number one product!!!
I have a lot of hair, so I'm worried, and I was wondering what to do with the one that is stuck like a sharp core, but now I have to take care of it with a body nature strip. Thank you so much for the good information ️
There is a lot of hair all over the body, and the thick and strong hair grows so fast.. Hair removal is essential for me in the summer! Yes~ I saw 4 of them at the store and was thinking about which one to use, but I just came out, but I decided to watch the video today and choose!
I used cream in the past, but my hair removal was fine, so I didn't use it, but the cream in the video is great!! I want to try the red wax too. I have a lot of hair, so a large capacity is great! I think I will be able to walk around with my arms up more confidently this summer.
I want to wear shorts in summer, but seeing the thick hair underneath makes me reluctant to wear them ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
I don't think my hair removal worries are there thanks to Olive Young.
I really like the combination too ㅠㅠ I have that body nature at my house, I really like it ️
I recommend it to everyone.
Epilator with soap!! I also tried it and it pushes really softly~ It feels softer because of the soap running~ But there may be places where it doesn't slide a little while pushing, so I had to watch it carefully and push it, but it was good because it didn't irritate me hehe
If there are only Olive Young hair removal products, all the Gorman problems related to hair removal are solved~~~~
It's really summer now, so I have to wear shorts and skirts, but because of my hair, I wore long pants even in the summer, but I think it would be really good if I had one hair removal done. I'm already trying for the third time in the event.
I really like Apple Sugar Wax. And after several failed attempts, it came out better when I applied it thinly.

Raw hair doesn't come out. Plus, the original ingrown hair, shaving with a razor, and all the lumps of sebum in the armpits disappear. Perfectly recommended for acne.
It must have been difficult to film the waxing content, but you did a good job.
I'm afraid to wear short sleeves in summer, so I'm the person who wears outerwear every day... I've seen the razor every time I go to Olive Young, but it's the first time I've seen soap with it. There is only one thing left to do is to get rid of these hairs quickly!! I want to wear short sleeves proudly this year
After watching this video, I got up the courage to write a wax strip.. Haha It really doesn't hurt as much as I thought. It just feels like taking off the tape
I'm sensitive, so I used a depilatory cream, but my skin was red, swollen, hurt, and upset ㅠㅠ Please test it before using it ㅜㅜ
I was still going to buy a waxing strip, but thanks to a video I happened to watch, I found out that there is also hair removal wax! thanks for the good info
I was thinking of removing my hair these days, but thank you for recommending the product.
The groom has a lot of hair, so I looked hard.
I recently bought a wax warmer.
I was in pain, so I looked at some depilatory cream.
The product and moisturizing power look good!
Ah ㅠㅜㅜTT Thank you so much ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ After thinking about it, I found out that there is a hair removal cream for the first time. Thank you for the really good information ㅠㅜㅜ
I've been struggling with hair removal for the past few days, but after seeing this video, I put on the Beauty Formula Hair Removal Cream and Chic Epilator right away ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Today was the last day of the sale.
I bought a chic epilator in the past when it was on sale, and now I'm using a different one, but it's annoying to soap and apply every time, so I came back to Chic.... That money is the money, so I bought the original product and 1 soap.
I had a lot of hair, so it was always stressful, but I couldn't buy it because hair removal products were a bit expensive.
Please do a base ranking like cushion foundation!!
Ugh ㅠㅠ If you have a lot of hair on your legs and arms, really
It's full of stress but it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much
thanks for uploading the video
Product number 1 I cut my hand while washing my hair.
Do not wash with your hands, it is best to wash under running water with a brush or a kitchen sponge!
Wow, Chic Intuition Shea Butter Epilator I really like this product. But I was very worried that the razor blade would cut me while I was doing it, but this never happens. Moisten the area to be removed with water and just swipe, the hair removal ends immediately. Even the berry scent is so good ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I use all of this and live in Olive Young. If you are worried about hair removal, really buy this. It's great ㅠㅠ It's not a waste of money!!!!!
I got a lot of cuts from shaving with a razor, but I want to try the product!
I don't have much hair on my arms or legs, but I have a lot of armpit hair hahahaha
If I wear really short sleeves, my hair always sticks out... ㅠ Please recommend a product that can remove armpit hair ㅠㅠ
Even though I’m a woman, I am forced to look like an orangutan because of my genes! If you have a lot of hair, thin and not thick, it’s semi-compulsory, but it’s thick and the color is completely steamy, so it’s forced. It's like..I don't usually wear skirts or shorts, and I can't wear them.. I have to wear stockings, but I ripped my stockings off in a few hours, so I've never really missed a day. I take it with me ㅠㅜㅠ So I want to receive any product!!
People with a lot of hair are said to be beautiful, but to me, hair is the biggest complex ㅠㅠ As shown in the video, when you remove your hair with a razor, the hair roots come out slightly, so it's the same situation. I will participate by posting it!! If I win this time, I am going to walk the streets with full of confidence this summer and show off my arms and legs!
I bought a shea butter depilatory cream because I have more hair than women, but I found out how to use it properly after watching this video haha
I am one of the hairy people.. I just had my hair removed, but it was so bad that I came in with tears in my eyes TTTT Please give me hope that I can have clean limbs this summer.
I tried the number one hair removal cream, but it is better not to apply it to areas like atopic skin.. It is not irritating to the skin at all, so I applied it a lot, and the hairy areas in the atopic area completely melted away, so I struggled for a few days.. If you have sensitive skin Use with caution
I'm sorry that the nair product I sold to my friend is not available!!! The nair Ultra Sensitive Cream is also very good....!!!!! I'm going to buy the top 5 next time too
I used a wax strip type product in the past and had a really hard time for a while as the skin shells were torn as it was when I took it off... So I can't use such a product because of trauma.
I've only used Beauty Formula Shea Butter hair removal cream, so I didn't know about other hair removal products, but through this video, I can't keep my mouth shut about the 21st century technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,,,,, looking at the weather these days, it seems summer is really approaching right in front of my nose.
I couldn't see the cherry blossoms much this year because of the corona, but I want to keep things tidy this summer. PD-nim Kwon is the princess.
I've always been worried about buying hair removal products, but there are only good tips.
I tried the same product with the cream product sponge, but the sponge was rough and irritated my skin
I'm going to school soon, and it's so stressful in the summer ㅠㅠ Really... I'm a student, so I don't know what products to buy and I don't have enough money, so apply for an event!!! I've never used a product like this before, but I want to use this opportunity to shave my hair ㅠㅠ
oh! The event is until today! Being a college student, I suffered from homework and final exams...but I was taking a break because it was my birthday today, but I came across a good review hehe

I use the Intuition product, which took the number one spot in the razor, and I highly recommend it! I bought it for the first time in high school, and I'm in love with 'convenience + soap attached + infinite refills', and I keep using the same product, changing only the scent :)
Hair all over your body? There are so many aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah good video i really enjoyed it
I really have a lot of hair on my legs.. I want to try a hair removal cream ㅜㅜ It seems that I can remove hair without any discomfort.
Olive Young teachers are really amazing Thank you for understanding the hearts of subscribers so well I almost wore long padding in the summer because of my hair. I think it's better because it informs people by type to those who are contemplating whether to buy olive young.
It's the biggest problem of summer...I found a solution!!
I have a question, is there no hair for a while after wiping after applying the depilatory cream?
There are so many different hair removal products!
I'm running to buy!
Aloe gel can be used for multiple purposes, so it is always a must, but I will have to purchase it with Aromatica ^^
It would be better if the price of each product was disclosed.
I'll have to run tomorrow for sure..
It came up on a recommendation video by chance, but I subscribed right away because the topic was so much my story.. Other places are ok, but my legs are especially hairy ㅠㅠ Ha... Really stress.... I have to push again soon as I grow up ㅠㅠ So it often stimulates my legs, so I want to try All Young products!!! Especially that cream is amazing right?! I'm really looking forward to it.. The introduction was long, but I really want to try it!!!!
I'm a woman.. I have no arms and hair on my legs, so I'm going to have to go and buy it! Thanks for the tip today!!
Ah,,,, thanks to you, I know a good product ㅠㅠ Thank you.
How do you know that I love you all, it appeared on the recommended video
It's so sad because he's a really easygoing person, but the fact that I found Gwangmyeong with a wax strip...!
I've tried all kinds of strange hair removal creams, razors, sugar wax, wax strips, etc., but the wax strip is the best ^
At first, I was too scared to make a wax strip, but once I tried it, it didn't hurt as much as I thought. Sugar wax has to be made, pulled, and pulled out one by one, but I'm a geekyist, so the wax strip is the best..!
School will start soon, so I think it will help a lot with school uniforms ㅠㅠ
I've seen a lot of that hair removal razor, I'll give it a try :)
When I was 1st in the All Young Guide, I received a moisturizing cream once, so I didn't apply for other events, but I came here because it was called a hair removal cream ㅠㅠ And my birthday is the announcement day ㅋㅋ Even though I'm a middle school student, I'm a girl who worries about laser hair removal and went to the hospital. When I wear stockings to wear a school uniform skirt, leg hairs come out of the stockings, and even the neck and back have a lot of hair, so I can't even imagine poop hair ㅠㅠ I was seriously thinking about it, but laser hair removal is expensive to do even the hair on the face. This is so burdensome ㅠㅠ I go to the hairdresser and the head shaves my neck. Wow...I really feel like my dad's beard when I touch it ㅠㅠ I really, really, really desperately need hair removal cream, so I'm participating like this ㅠㅠ I want to shave my legs too ㅠㅠ Please I want to win ㅠㅠ All Alain The guide is always cheering for you!!
Wow ㅠㅠ Thank you so much I don't know why I'm watching this video now ㅜㅜ Thank you so much All Young Forever!!!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I've always been worried about hair removal every summer because I have a lot of hair, but this time I'm going to buy Nair Apple Sugar Wax! thanks for the good video
I'm trying to remove my hair for the first time in my life, but I started with this
I want to try..!!!
How long is the expiration date on the products here?? So, how long does it last after hair removal?? I am really worried because my hair grows so fast ㅠㅠ
There are more hairy people in the comments than on the product, so I feel comforted ㅠ I feel empathized ㅁ.. ㅠㅠ
I bought the No. 1 hair removal cream, but Olive Young sells it for 12,000 won, so I'll buy two quickly and post a review in an hour.
Legs... I'm a woman too, but I'm a person with Amazon, so I prefer long pants to shorts every summer... I have so much hair on my body that I'm actually a man, but I have a lot of strange thoughts... .. So, as a result of using some hair removal products, hair removal creams and razors are not irritating and they are okay, but products with stimulation are also relatively long-lasting, so you can choose according to your taste! Now that it's summer again, I have to push one more time, but I'd rather have children who are okay without irritation... I recommend it!
I was so worried about my hair, so I thought about what to do, but I just shaved it off with a knife to tidy up my eyebrows, but my hair keeps growing, so it's more stressful ㅜㅜ I've never shaved before, but I'm a little scared because the wax will hurt ㅜㅜ But I don't think the cream will fit because I have sensitive skin. If anyone has used all 5 of these, please leave a comment here ㅜㅜ
Chini? The reaction is good.
I'm a student, would it be okay if I removed my hair with an epilator and moisturized well?
I tried the hair removal cream shown in the video, but I think it's because I have a lot of hair. After a day or two, the hair starts to grow again. I think wax is better than cream.
Oh oh oh oh oh, hair removal products like a buffet!!!
I love it so much~~~~
Does the sharpness remain even after hair removal with depilatory cream?
From what age can it be used?
Is it possible with short hair?
The season for hair removal is coming soon~~~ What to do with leg hair.. Shea Butter epilator Oh~~ It's so good^^
I need to try self-waxing hahahaha
I've never used a razor except for a razor, but I just found out that there are so many hair removal products at Olive Young.

What surprised me was the Beauty Formula Shea Butter Hair Removal Cream!
As for wax, the Nezu Natural Hair Remover Gel, which is not sold at Olive Young right now, was the best.
Hmm, is it true that when hair grows back after using hair removal products, it grows thicker??
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I recommend something that has had an effect on the armpit hair. It's short, so it didn't work well with a razor.
hey it's so good??? I have a lot of hair on my legs, so it wasn't originally like that, but it's getting more and more so I can't wear a dress because I'm embarrassed because of the hair, so if I want to wear a skirt, it's really hard to wear a long skirt. I think it would be comfortable! Thank you so much for today's good video, it's Corona again these days, everyone, be careful!!! Actually, I didn't know Olive Young was selling depilatory creams and epilators... It's a perfect tip haha
Wow thank you so much ㅠㅜㅜ Although I am a woman, I know people with a lot of hair, but I have had a complex with them since ancient times. I cried a lot because I was teased by boys a lot. You didn't give me permission until then, but one day my mom suddenly said, "I can't do it, check out a hair removal cream," so I'm looking for it, but I don't know.
So thank you!!
I have sensitive skin, so I can't use any depilatory cream. I bought a sensitive type depilatory cream for armpit hair removal, but I washed it off with pain in less than a minute, and I can't attach it to my armpit for several days. I recommend chamomile depilatory cream for sensitive people. I don't know if they still sell it.
I've been using the Souk Intuition Shea Butter razor for several years.
I've been wanting to try a hair removal cream. You said that the recommended product is that famous? I see ^^
I've only used a razor and this is my first hair removal cream, so I didn't know what to buy, but All Young recommends it, so I believe it.
It's been really hot since a few days ago, so maybe that's why people just walked around the entrance of short-sleeved shorts~ I think the season for hair removal has arrived!!
If I use that depilatory cream, when my hair grows back, won't it be rough?
As someone who bought 3 refills of Intuition epilator and purchased 4 times in total, I will write a review for those who are curious.
The advantage is that it slides really smoothly. Wow! I don't know if it's been pushed... And there's no stinging or pain while being pushed. In addition, since the soap is on the top and bottom on a raw basis, it glides through the foam, so it is less stimulated as much as possible. Smells good too. It is easy to manage because it is refillable. The downside is that this is also an epilator, so it hurts if you push it with force. Also, be careful because curved body parts can be cut! (I cut my toes out of curiosity hahaha). After using it for a really long time, the only downside is that the hair is still brittle, but there is no way to remove the hair on the blade. So in the end, if you want to use it for a while, you have to throw it away when there is a lot of soap on the days when there was not much soap.
What is the best way to remove areola hair? The areola is a sensitive area.
I'd rather it grow as thin as a piece of wool
I... my hair is like a normal man... Would it be okay if I only used a razor? Up until this point, I used depilatory cream and shaved off the hairs that came out, but what do I do with the hairs that have fallen off after removing my hair with a razor?
Are there areas where hair removal wax should not be used?
I bought a depilatory cream to remove my hair, but something went wrong, I'll have to try the Olive Young hair removal cream this time.
Is it true that when I use the depilatory cream, the hair roots remain, leaving very small black dots? Some say it grows thicker and longer when it comes out again.
Tell me what to do ㅠㅠ Summer is just what I need~ Just!!!
Sugar Wax...I'm scared, but the testimonial effect is great..
I'm in preparation, but there's a lot of hair on my legs and arms. ㅠㅠ Now I have to wear a skirt, but they don't allow laser treatments or anything like that, and I'm only a week away from school and I don't know what to do ㅠㅠ I really want a hair removal cream ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I know that hair is really a lot...
Last summer, I wore only refrigerator pants (?) and shorts twice??
My friends also said they want to see me in shorts hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
So I shaved it with an eyebrow knife... It was bleeding and it just turned red, so I just wore long pants...
I need to buy a hair removal cream because I don't want to get sick~ I think it's a good item ^^
Well, all the comments are people with a lot of hair ㅠㅠ There are so many people like this that you can’t believe it even if you write so many things, but I don’t want to wear short sleeves in the summer because I’m so tall for my age, but after watching the video, I want to shave my hair again ㅠㅠ I watched the video so well. Taking that off?? It's really amazing... I want to do it... lol I enjoyed watching the video
Hair removal... I desperately want to do this ㅠㅠㅠㅠ My body is full of hair...
Oh, I know razors well, but I'm new to other things, so I'm thinking of buying it haha
It's the first time I've seen aloe vera gel, oh oh oh oh
I'm a real woman, but my leg hair grows fast, so I want to use wax.
I think I've used a depilatory cream razor, but in general, it's soapy, so once I use it, the soap gets wet, so it's a bit greasy. A person with thick hair like me doesn't shave on the highway several times and the hair removal cream...the smell is creamy when I use it, so I can't help it. It's strange and disgustingly melted.. Unless you really apply a lot, the hair removal doesn't go well.. If you apply it on both sides of your calf, it's hard to sit down for fear that the medicine will get on your chair or pants. Ham..good for thin hair removal, but not for thick hair removal..
What would be good for a teenager to do...?
Is the hair good for removing the hair on the forehead?
It's not a lot of hair, but it's long and thick, so I have some masculine leg hair. When I was in elementary school, while playing in the valley at a retreat, a boy saw my legs and said, "Hey!! ㅇㅇㅇ Leg hair is very thick!!!” And shouting to the kids as a joke, and after that, even if I shave my leg hair after that, I don't think it will look like it's engraved. The basics of hair are itchy, itchy, bare, and swollen at every root, so I can't even remove my hair when I need it. On the day I want to wear a skirt, if my legs aren't in good condition, I can't do it because I can't do it. Getne, this is my last hope.
Can the razor be used on the face?
I'm using Beauty Formula's hair removal cream, but the shea butter epilator was sold˃̵͈̑ᴗ˂̵͈̑ It looks so easy, so I'll have to buy it!! 2:18 I'm biting a towel. Qㅠㅜㅜ I can't do hair removal strips and wax because it hurts..
I bought a razor for hair removal today and tried it.
How many days does it take for the hair to grow back?
I'm using that sugar wax, and I got a bruise when I took it off... The way to do it is difficult and it doesn't harden well, so it takes a long time ㅠㅠ
Everyone do lasers... Shinsegae...
I bought a chic epilator raspberry? It smells like raspberry? I bought it yesterday when it was on sale and my hair was pulled well ㅋㅋ I’m a woman, but I also have a lot of hair on my legs (like my dad) so it’s too ugly for a woman’s legs ㅋㅋ I bought it and tried to shave my hair, but it’s pretty good~
Awesome it's so good!! They both have a lot of hair, so I was really worried, but I think I'll go to Olive Young tomorrow and buy all of them one by one hehe.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaftyforeveryone Um, I was really hesitant because of the bad news about hair removal, but I think I'll be relieved if I buy one of the five out there. Thank you for recommending a product that can calm you down.
I have a lot of hair, but I have never shaved my hair.. I have to do it every day.

I didn't do it because I was afraid that it would grow more and thicker if I do it, but I still want to try it ㅠㅠ
Wow, you're going to pick this yourself hahahaha It's Olive Young
You said that Beauty Formula Shea Butter Hair Removal Cream smells like a drug, but does it disappear quickly? After seeing this, I got a lot of information.
Oh, I really hate summer the most ㅠㅠ I'm rich with my arms and I hate rich people so much ㅠㅠ I think I'm shorter because I'm mini. Thank you for the recommendation ㅠㅠ
Can I use Beauty Formula Hair Removal Cream for sensitive skin..?
My leg hairs started to reincarnate again. However, leg hairs should not be reincarnated. Therefore, I look forward to Olive Young's helping hand.><
The tape type is not recommended for the legs, use it only for the forearms.
Is the Shank Intuition Shea Butter epilator blade disposable?
I'm tempted to go to Olive Young tomorrow
I shave my legs
To remove hair, I have to do all the thighs and insteps, but it's a job...
Can I just use the last product as a lotion??
I really want it ㅜㅜ (I have more hair than other people ㅜㅜ)
Is it possible for all arms, legs and hands?..I have a lot of hair on my arms, legs, and hands... And are there any side effects?
What products can be used on the face? I'm trying to do it on my face.
I need an extra 1,000 won ⍤⃝𓂭 for the લો coupon that has the money⍤⃝𓂭 in the લો coupon that I have questions about.
I bought Nair Apple Sugar Wax after seeing this video, but it's absolutely not good...
It's just sticky and I can't even remove my hair... Am I using it wrong?
I kept repeating washing, wiping, applying, and pasting, but it didn't work...
I tried the armpits 6 times, then gave up and used a razor;
Ah, princess of armpit hair, it's time to slowly remove hair.. Intuition is the best for armpit hair removal.
Is it ok to use Neo Apple on the back hair??
The first product originally had a cradle,,,,,, I must have thrown it away,,,
The first product is not to push, but to pick, please answer
I am 16, can I remove my hair with wax products?
But wouldn't it be useless if you knew it was a shampoo?
I bought Body Nature Gel Hair Removal Body All Skin with Red Fruit from Olive Young... (Oh, it doesn't appear in this video...)
My arm has something like hives (?) and it hurts every time it touches my clothes.
Maybe it's because this doesn't suit me....Some have a bit of a pitted(?)...(Slightly dented...)
I love you olive
Do you still dig this..?
Where did you recruit the man with glasses? Does Olive Young hire a manager through produce?
Can you use that sugar wax on your face? There's hair on his cheeks, so he looks a bit like a werewolf.. I want to rip it off ㅠㅠ
Maybe the first epilator... I'm carefully asking...
I wonder if it is possible to use it for important parts....
There is more variety than you think.
Am I the only one who is surprised every time it comes out in an advertisement...?
Nair Apple Sugar Wax is the worst. I pulled out 10 underarm hairs, and I tried 3 or 4 times, and only 3 strands were pulled out. Adhesion is too weak. I thought about whether I should harden it and use it, but the user manual doesn't say that. I was sweating hard while waiting. It took me over 40 minutes to do it in the bathroom. There were more than half left, but I threw them all away.
Hair Removal Cream... Live... Live!!! hello!
Is there any product that removes color ㅠ I want to use it on colored areas such as armpits, elbows, neck, etc. If there is a product that does not remove color, please recommend!!
I lost all of my hair removal products because I moved to the house ㅠㅠ I went to Olive Young to buy that sugar wax, so they said it was out of stock ㅠㅠ Please help me, the rich hairy guy ㅠㅠ
PD Kim is handsome
I'd like to try on something like nasi at least once, but this guy's armpit hair is a problem. What should I use to remove my armpit hair?
Can Nair Apple Sugar Wax be used on the face?
I'll have to try a hair removal cream next summer.
I'm going to Olive Young now.
The man with glasses is so respectful
I miss the razor ㅜㅜ
The stickiness of the sugar wax was a big failure...
Go offline and buy Olive Young..? I can't buy it alone..? I really can't buy it, what should I do ~~~~ ㅠㅠ
Green Beauty Formula Shea Butter Cream Do not use it on your armpits, it will really soften...
Can I use any of the razors on the top? I want to push only my fingers, the back of my hand, and my ankle
🥺🥺🥺 amazon
Shea Butter Epilator Does it matter for men or women? I'm debating whether to buy a cream or a razor...
last care
PD Kwon looks a bit like Ahn Jae-hyun..
Is it okay to use that underarm red hair cream on the genital area?
Can I use Beauty Formula Hair Removal Cream on my chest hair?
Is shea butter epilator okay for men to use?
Can I use it on my face?
Can I use the product shown here on the armpit???
If the performance is that low, why go to a wax shop?
Does this make the hair thicker?
Can I use it on a boat?
I can't use this kind of razor for fear that it won't be clean and it's bad for my skin.
Do you also sell in stores?
What should a man do?
2:50 4:05
I'm... a beauty, right?...
I think hair removal is etiquette.. Men don't like to see the jungle..
=========End of Crawling===========
The concept is perfectly managed. People who are good at steaming are advertising, so if you just follow me, I will too.
No, why do they both have such good voices ㅠㅠ I love you, Olyoung, who caught both Noonhogang and Gwihogang...♡
 I go there often and turn it on often, but the fact that my favorite tanky combination was advertised, so I like it even more!
All Young x Tanky Let's last a long time!!
Really.. you took such a pretty picture, every time I see it, I'm enchanted ㅠㅠ I hope that Olyoung, Nolto, and Tanky will have more fun ( ˘ ³˘)
All-young chemistry perfect for tanky siblings who are perfect both inside and outside!

0:09 Flawless skin male god

0:22 All-time legend, goddess of beauty, Bonnie and Clyde, we always love you!!!!!!! (*ˊᵕˋoo
Where are you in now? Advertising planner? Come on, get a round of applause and trophies. Are you aiming for Cannes with advertisements?! Perfect, perfect! Truly the best idol brother and sister tank of this era
I really like the tank x key chemistry, but to be an all-young model together like this!! 1st wish Gwanggwang Urukta All routines in the world
All-Young fits perfectly into my daily routine even if they each have a different routine! On a tiring day, on the way home from work, on the way home from work or on the go, Olive Young, which is just what I need these days, is twice as good ♡~♡
Ha... Thank you, Olive Young, for recognizing the best brother and sister tank tank of this era,,, ️️️ As a 1n-year Sowon and Shawol, I can't be this happy these days ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm an All-Young lover, but I'm going to rob him more often in the future hahaha Tanky-chan and SM What do you feel when you see this??? Taeyeon's key unit or tanky unit...
The tanky combination is the best. Olive Young, who takes care of your daily routine, is the best!
Tanky made of the same material from face to tone!! It's a combination that really calms the mind and body.
Taeyeon and Key are so funny together! You can for sure feel that bother/sister vibe that they have going on after being labelmates for so many years. Their chemistry is flawless. And they are the perfect spokespeople for this brand as they have amazingly clear skin!
The chemistry is really good, let's keep going with this combination!!
My dream duo doing the most incredible job promoting together. They look so radiant and fresh
Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-beom.... It's a combination that can't be perfect anymore Ha I really love you ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Tanky union is unconditionally a success.. Every time I pass by Olive Young, I am happy to have Tanky. I dedicate my wallet to Olive Young..
To be honest, people who like Taeyeon and Kibum will be very much in favor of this tanky combination. The two get along so well and they are so cool. It’s great to see them doing something together through the All Young advertisement. 'On' to watch!!️
It feels like yesterday when my tangoo sister danced while shopping at Olive Young on tangoo TV.
I became an Olive Young advertisement model.
Thank you so much for working hard these days ㅠㅠ
I really love this combination! I wish you all the best this year too~
It's an honor to be able to see the best sibling association tanky of the present time at Olive Young after Nolto. I love seeing the people I see in Nolto every week at Olyoung too. I really appreciate Olyoung’s recruiting skills.
Originally, I went there often, but thanks to her excellent model selection, I will use it more often in the future.
The ultimate self-management king, Tanky, is the model ㅠㅠ I think I'll be using Olive Young a lot ️ Skin products and food are now at All Young! I've installed the app. Go shopping right now!
K-pop legend Kim brother and sister, what's going on... No, why do you have such a good voice... If you keep doing this, you're only the best in the world Tanky
Taenggo & Key, who have a great concept and show great and fun chemistry in Nolto, please shoot more commercials together in the future.
隨OLIVEYOUNG

I was so happy to even see Olive Young, Taeyeon and Key’s co-model, and I will continue to follow only Olive Young!
I really like these two combinations...♡
It's so good that you thought of using these two as models
I'm so happy every time this ad comes out!
The posters on the front of the All Young store are really great, tanky earth universe.
Thank you very much Olive Young ️
The combination of Taeyeon unnie's pretty face and Kibeom oppa's handsome face
I'm falling in love with the olive young you chose once again ㅠㅠ I'm still using Olive Young, but I'm going to go there more often ㅋㅋ Tanky Combination Forever!!
Kim Tae-yeon X Kim Ki-beom I love you Olive Young, the best 2nd generation K-pop legend.
They're both so cute, so what should I do? They're perfect.. I think it's better because they're usually liked by people.. From now on, skin care products will be All Young ^^...
The best combination I love!!! The chemistry between the two was really good, and I really liked them because they worked so hard, but it's so good that the two of them even advertised like this ㅜㅜ Olive Young, who won these two really, is the winner!!! I always support Taeyeon and Key!!!! I love you!!!
The tank key combination has no choice but to be successful ㅠㅠ The staff know that chemistry is so good and use it as a promotional model ㅠㅠ As a fan who really likes Sowon and SHINee, thank you so much Olive Young, who works so well, I will use it a lot hehe
After all, it is so good to see people who debuted around the same time and who have talents and skills that are recognized and respected by everyone in the music industry through great efforts as well as talents are still doing great things in the same program, and it is so good to see them filming advertisements together. I hope you are healthy and doing well every day. I support you!
Happy to see Taeyeon and Key together doing what they love and be happy
The true god of self-management = Tanky Kim brothers and sisters very good models
Tanky is so love ㅠㅠㅠㅠ This combination is the best of All Youngs who shot a perfect commercial with this combination... I always enjoyed watching them in Nolto with their perfect chemistry. It's great to be together in commercials. Besides, this ad fits so well with the image of the two of them who are well managed in the entertainment industry ㅠㅠ Believe it See Tanky Combination
Wow, the chemistry is really cool ㅜㅜ The people I like are so happy when the sun sets ﹏ Olive young I love you
I really have been waiting for this combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like it ㅠㅠ I love both of them.
I can't help but love and like this combination tanky ㅠㅜㅠㅜㅜ I decided to shoot my heart very... If I model an advertisement like this, I will run to Olive Young right away!!! Thank you Olive Young
Bonnie and Clyde from Nolto
Tanky, who shows the best chemistry, even took over the Olive Young commercial, so I'm happy with steam.
The whole time I was watching the All Young commercial, I couldn't get my mouth down because of Tanky's beauty.
Thank you very much to the advertiser who chose Tanky as the advertising model.
Kim Ki-beom, who is good at self-management, recommends Olive Young, but you can't buy it, right? Just wait for Olive Young, I'll give you some money~
The two have a unique chemistry, and their friendship is a symbol of true love between friends who inspire me. Their faces are great to get on TV, their expressions fill me with happiness, and they are really lucky to have them for this brand. I wish a lot of good health for everyone <3
Seriously, who came up with this combination? Two people who I think will go to Olive Young more than anyone else and will buy more if they go hahaha I love Tanky Olive Young too
Olive Young is the best. Thank you for allowing us to see the real tanky combination. Our brothers and sisters are still proud of the great chemistry since we fixed Nolto Tango and are giving off a lot of happiness. To hear that this chemistry is taking over advertising, Olive Young is just life. For me, I always go or go. This is Olyoung going
They both really get along really well, and the camilla I was expecting from Nolto is really, really, really, really great ️ Really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really handsome ㅠ Taeyeon unnie is so pretty,,, ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I will absolutely shed all of this ㅜㅜ
Taeyeon, who is famous for her nose, who always loves Olyoung, and Key, who is passionate about management, as models, Olyoung is a genius genius !! She used to be an all-young who visits often even if she doesn’t have anything to buy, but now she’s once to watch a tanky commercial, once to see new products, and once again for sales! I was completely full because I went more often, but I went once again to a package with a tanky for purchases of 50,000 won or more.. I needed hair dye in a hurry, so I used the Dream service for the first time today and experienced a new world ㅠㅠ Without sweating in hot weather, I didn’t have to go. What a great advantage it is that you can receive it immediately after a few hours ㅠㅠ!! I look forward to more routines, advertisements, products, and tanky advertisements to be revealed in the future ♡♡
Taeyeon and Key!!!! Kim’s siblings never let you down️‍ Olive Young must to go when you travel in Korea! Beauty & Food, be Crazy And I want that donut
Olyoung is really good at her job.. Today Olive Young passed by and took a picture of a poster in front of me as if possessed and came here Taeyeon Pingmer is really crazy ㅜㅜ
Wow, the commercials were really well shot. The beauties are awesome. Really, Tanky is the best.
Combination of self-management king Ki-beom and life routine ••• Isn't it the perfect model that makes you want to buy the same product you actually use? I visit Olive Young often, and I will go more •• or turn it on !!!
Tanky combination is so good hehe It's nice to advertise All Young together. It feels so good to see All Young commercials before seeing Nolto.
Tanky showing off the strongest chemistry at Nolto! Congratulations on entering Olive Young! Tanky's friendly image and Olive Young's concept go really well with each other! Ads are very intuitive and the tanks are pretty.
Tanky~~~~♡ In Nolto, we made only good times for the viewers with our very good chemistry, but we became models for Olive Young together like this ㅠㅠ I really like it Oh I really don't know who does Olive Young's job well, so does everyone in the world know? Olive Young is awesome!! Taeyeon and tall!!
Our tanky, who are usually made of very similar material, have the same variety shows and even the same commercials TTTT The two are perfect and I don’t use the app well because I have an All-Young in front of my house, but these days I see the two of them and turn on the app often hahaha It feels like I’ve done it more times than I go now? ! just right
Taeyeon and Kirani are excellent choices! The kings of self-management!!
It's better because it's really well managed, pretty, and it's two celebrities of the same age, so I'm more trusting because Taeyeon actually uploaded a video of her going to Olive Young! And I really like the advertisement because it expresses the life of a different routine well in the advertisement. The tanky look is crazy in the commercials, so every time I see the commercials, I get excited.
A tanky combination that I really trust and see. Personally, I think both models are really good images for Olive Young! I used to go there occasionally, but I think I will close the store more often. I look forward to continuing the chemistry between All Young and Tanky!!!
I did a lot of delivery on the same day through the Olive Young app, but it was a pity that it wasn't well known. ️ I am very much looking forward to what Tanky will do in the future ️‍Go to various contents or turn it on! I want to be there often
I've really liked SHINee for a long time and I really like Taeyeon too, but it's really good that the two of you collaborated like this It suits you
The chemistry between the two tanks is so incredibly good ㅠㅠ
As soon as August came, I immediately ran all the way and spit it out.
All-Young
Why is Kim Taeyeon's primary color so good ㅜㅜ Green and crimson are perfect, really... Tanky's voice is perfect for All Young, so keep it for a long time ㅜㅜ
Aren't the copies of all the routines in the world and Olyoung fit together so well!! As a representative of all-young's favorite consumers (? I think this advertisement was chosen very well >.< I am so happy that today's Dream service, which I use especially when I need something urgently, is also introduced. Besides, the advertisement model is also a tanky... The person who promoted the model Even if you don't know who you are, I hope you get a bonus.
I've been watching a 30-second ad for 30 minutes... I'm pretty serious about tanky...
I usually buy skincare in bulk through online shopping! If I had known about the all-young app, which is so fast and convenient, I would have used it a long time ago. I will use it habitually in the future! All young often, see you for a long time!!
The chemistry between the two who manage the best and fit the best in the commercials makes their chemistry even more exploding. As they are both people who are interested in beauty, I think they fit the brand name of Olive Young so well and trust me ㅠㅠ I didn’t know the Olive Young app well, but I downloaded this advertisement !! I think it will be more convenient to use in the future
The tanky combination is really... It's the best ㅠㅠ All-Young also has an eye for models, so if you need it urgently to buy skin lotions, etc., you can use the app.
The best thing All-Young did this year: Using Tanky as a model!!! I really like it ㅠㅠ I use and love All Young often, but I appreciate all the routines!! But it suits Tanky so well and it's perfect,,,,, thank you for choosing a model!! Happy Olive Young! i love you tanky
I really like Tanky Cammy, but commercials ㅠㅠ All Young is the best. Still, there are many All Young stores, so it is easy to access and sells, so I visited often. !!! All young best best
Taeyeon flaunting her visuals on her her cfs lol.She has been doing well this year with several cfs after she appeared back in tv, even if its a cable show only. her her face her everywhere with Olive Young and on pizza boxes too lol Doing it like a 4th gen IT girl on her 14 year and at 32
I didn't have to go to Olive Young because I didn't wear makeup, so I mostly bought skincare on the internet, but the Olive Young app is not working.

After I found out that there are, I heard it was fun to compare and shop! There are more types than I thought and they are convenient ㅠㅠ No online these days, I pass by and go in every time I see an Olive Young store even if I don’t have anything to buy.. In the end, buying a lot of food and fattening it up deliciously is a routine these days. I love you all young Tanky
Trusted and seen tanky combination ‧⁺◟( ᵒ̴̶̷̥́ ·̫ ᵒ̴̶̷̣̥̀ ) !! I am so happy to be able to see Tanky at Olive Young, which is the closest thing to our daily life!! How did you choose the concept so perfectly?
Totally perfect tangoo unnie and Kibum themselves!! I think the commercials were neat and simple too ㅠㅠ The two of them really like their cami too, but you don't know how happy they were to hear that they were filming a commercial together this time.
Kim Ki-beom × Kim Tae-yeon It's a combination that I can't help but love.. The real chemistry fits perfectly and the commercials are well shot, both are so cute
I love you Olive Young for making a good advertisement
It's really really great ㅠㅠ The Kim siblings are really chemistry what can I do ㅠㅠ Please push me more I love you Olive Young, really beautiful.
If lovelyness is personified, isn't that... 'Taengoo'?
Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool!!!
Tanky combination is really cool!! ㅠㅠ Tango Kibum is so pretty Tanky forever~
The concept is really perfect, I think I can improve my skin like Tanky, and that's just it.
Please model for a long time!!
Tanky union is crazy ㅠㅠ I feel that All Young is really good at their job, they are both kings of self-management, so the image of Olive Young and Olive Young are perfect. Now use only olive young~ That's what it means. I still liked Olive Young, but now I only go here.
Taengoo is a real fairy ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Really good influence is the best!! What Forbes All-Young did well in 2021!
Olive Young I usually go really often, but the model I like is Tanky ㅠㅠ I also played Nolto a lot because of Tanky, thank you for using me as a tanky model ㅠㅠ!!! Thank you for giving lots of content and events so that Shawol and Sowon don’t disappoint.
I'm going to get the best olive young in Tanky Guild.
This combination is a steamed combination. The two usually get along well, and they showed off their friend-like chemistry and even filmed an advertisement hehe I think anyone in the world will take care of their lifestyle!! I usually use All Young, but I need to use this report more often!! Because All Young is just life
I love you CJ I love you Olive Young

Tanky's beauty, diction, and voice are just perfect...
The best combination of tanky... Two people who are the ultimate self-management adverts for Olive Young, so I think they'll buy more with confidence I'm happy, I love you, Olive Young, I love you, Tanky.
️The tanky brother and sister Ki-bum, who turned Olive Young upside down with a perfect concept, is serious about managing so many hand-made items, but I really met the water this time!! Why is my wallet more open to tanky ads than olive young sales? As much as the synergy shown in Nolto, I look forward to seeing the good side of the two at All Young!! All Young Tanky Siblings Huay Teng
huh.. hey TTTT Nolto and the two of them really like their chemistry, so I thought it would be nice if they did an advertisement...
This tank combination is so cute
Her older sister's face is ha ha, so she seems to have a light coming out of her face and she is tall .. ((tak on forehead)) ️ So handsome .. ㅠ I love you ex !! Let's go tanky union forever!!!!!
The tank combination is so cool ㅜㅜㅜㅜ I hope we can see you more often in the future~!
It goes well with the images of Tanky and Olive Young and I love it ㅠㅠㅠㅠ!! The advertisement came out so neat and pretty.... People who are passionate about self-management tell me that I believe in Olive Young and go and grow one more time ㅜㅜb
Omg they are so perfect , Olive Young you really did a great job to pair this sibling
A tanky combination that never fails. Infinite thanks to Olive Young for allowing me to see this combination,
The concept is so good! With two people who are more persuasive than anyone else, just a perfect advertisement was born. Tanky So, with Olive Young, I will continue to follow my own routine hehe I love you!
I've always liked Taeyeon and Key since before Nolto, but while watching Nolto, I fell in love with their chemistry even more, I really liked seeing the two Olive Young commercials hahaha. The Olive Young officials who were chosen as models for Taeyeon and Key, only walk on the flower path... ︎
The tank combination is so perfect..☆
Isn't this the perfect advertisement for a tanky who is good at taking care of himself ㅠㅠ I love you. Let's be together in the future.
I really don't think there's a model that suits you so well anywhere.
Perfect digestion! Tanky combination leads me to All Young.
Wow, really, how do you know how often you go to Olive Young and that our SHINee Kibum is a model? And with the cool Taeyeon~~!~! Both of them are so cool, cute, and stylish, no joke!! I'll be going there often in the future!!
The fact that the management and the best visuals filmed an All-Young commercial ㅇㅇ It's perfect ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's very comfortable to look at because the picture is similar, I just focus every time the advertisement comes up. Absolutely agree with the tanky combination!! Can't miss it...!!!
I originally liked Olyoung, but when Tanky advertises, I feel like I will bury my bones in Olyoung for the rest of my life ㅠTTTTTT Two people who are good-natured and take good care of themselves are advertised, so every time Olive Young passes by, they go in and buy what they need and come out just like that.. Thank you for letting Keybeom film the commercial Olive Young Money in breath, money out breath..
Tanky that you can trust and see + All-Young that you trust and purchase This is the Godwall itself!!! I'm happy to be able to see the chemistry between the two people I love so much through Olive Young again.
As soon as I heard the news that the model was a tanky, I made a vow.... I would only use Allyoung for the rest of my life. I usually go in right away when I see Allyoung, but now the tanky is bigger, so I think I will go in and buy it The best... I love CJ Allyoung, I love Tanky, I will use it more often in the future
The combination of Olive Young and tanky TTTT Both of them are so pretty and the concept is perfect~~
Oh, I really love Kibum so much, I love tango terribly, and I love the tanky combination double, but the commercial model is tanky ㅠㅠ
To see Tanky and read brochures, I went all over the place and bought some things.
Praise Olive Young, who uploaded it as soon as 12 o'clock,,,
As expected, I believe in the tanky combination. I'm going to go buy skin products right away
Combination I love... Really...
Tanky chemistry is the best
I can't tell you the chemistry between the two ㅠㅠ Besides, they are people who are good at self-management...? These are the great people who go to Olive Young to steal my wallet.
Olive Young, who picked this perfect advertising model? great people
All-Young advertisements are perfect for Tanky~~~ He is a strict self-manager, and he is very pretty and well-managed. He suits All Young so well ️ Every time I see All Young on the street, I like the models that automatically make me want to enter the store when I see a poster.
It's so good to see a real tanky combination like this ㅠㅠ I really applaud Allyoung's excellent choice Tanky and Allyoung are great ️‍
The concept is perfect, and the chemistry between the two is very good.. I've never been to Olive Young, but if I go, I'm really wasting my money..
This union. It's crazy ㅠㅠ They're both really good at managing them, so they're perfect ㅠ
Taeyeon and Key looking young like 4th gens so cute Cf
There is no better combination than this.. Tanky Olive Young's ad suits you so well and I really like it ㅠㅠ
All-young is really just life ️ The sparrow in the All-Young Mill that you can hear when you go out is folding. Tanky even models, so it’s even harder not to go there?! Every time I see All Young commercials on TV, I feel so good
Bonnie and Clyde Tanky Guild that you can trust and see
Two well-known self-management kings in Koduk are advertising, so I think I'll go to Olive Young more often!!
I need to save some money to choose Olive Young's advertising model so well.
Please stay with Olive Young Kim and sister for a long time.
Really the best combination of this time ㅠㅠㅠㅠ They are very trustworthy models, they are just perfect
Olive Young was selected as the model with the best combination! Anyway, these days, every time I pass by Olive Young, I feel so happy ㅠㅠ Olive Young teachers work less and earn a lot
Taeyeon x Key perfect combination
My favorite combination.
it came out so pretty
I'm always watching you in Nolto, and I feel better because you're even filming commercials.
I often go to Olive Young these days because Tanky filmed an advertisement, but I think I'm actually going to Olive Young to see Tanky's photos.
Tanky ㅠㅠ The model selection is perfect... I want to follow all the routines of the sisters and sisters that I manage, and I feel healed by looking at the tanky poster when the olive youngs are passing by these days... . I really love you Olive Young! The launch of Jungsaemmul (!!!) and the selection of tanky models are also my taste for all-young picks!!!!!!! My routine, my wallet is young, #OliveYoung, it's all of you..young
Originally, I took my wallet, but now I'm dedicating my bankbook. The combination of the steamed brother and sister, Tango and Kier, who have always been thorough after their debut, is a crazy combination. It was an excellent choice,,,
If it's a real beom and tangu, we've talked about it all!!! I don't really like YouTube ads, but when I see this ad in the middle of watching YouTube, I don't hate it hahaha I'm just following along and saying "Go or turn it on!" Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I really like the tanky cami in Nolto, so I watch it like my nieces and nephews are filming a commercial together.
I can't get over it, really... When an advertisement comes out, her pink hair is fresh

Goddess and our shining beautiful baby are coming out, really ㅠTTTT It is the light of the advertising world. I hope the testimonials continue to come out ㅠㅠㅜㅜ It’s all three volumes, so I go often, but it got better.
Tomorrow is August 1st! After going to the academy, I immediately run to Olive Young~ I can be this happy because there is Olyoung in the building right next to the academy!! She had a lot of things she wanted to buy, but she was holding back, but thanks to Kibum oppa, she decided to go!
Both of the concepts really go well together ㅠㅠ Kibum is so pretty!!
To take Tanky Jinri Guild from such a perfect company ㅜㅜ I'm really happy that they fit together so well
Olive Young choose the right couple for this ad! Taeyeon and Key have their special characteristic to follow the cheerful style of Olive Young ^^
It's the combination of the two I love the most ㅠㅠ Girl idols are tangoo, male idols are taller the most ㅠㅠ The chemistry between the two is no joke, I really love Olive Young.
Participation complete!!

I love the production crew who are so sincere towards the performers.. I really love them.. I love them because they are my kids. At first, I started watching tango with Kibum, but I felt the production team caring for the performers and it got better and better, so I became a Nolto fan!! Of course, I always watch it as a clip when I take a break while eating!! Noolaemi is happy every day.. Please continue to take care of Kibum and Taenggo. I will support you until the end.
No, I think you read the flow well. Really... To use Tango and Key as a model for an advertisement... Oh my gosh, Taengoo on a horse is so pretty and crazy, with pink hair here we go... I'm happy...Pink hair owner..I should.... No, anyway, thank you Olive Young ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's tanky ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's tanky!!!!!! Really, it's the best thing I've done in All Young. It's just a personal questionnaire Yes... Yeah, I'm so happy ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Oh, if I had known this would be the case, I would have bought Allyoung's stock earlier. Ah... I'm going to buy 10 weeks right now.... ... From now on, I will only go to Olyoung. Yes, take care of my Tango unnie. I will pay for one door at the headquarters of Olyoung.... Then... Then, in the future, until Olyoung reaches 10 trillion won in annual sales, when I buy an apartment of 35 pyeong or more. I'm trying my best... Let's achieve one of the two. It's good if we achieve both... Heh... Tango... Just... Keep releasing albums like this... I love you Kim Tae-yeon Hee-hee....
These two are too cute for this world, I want to use this app because of them
The next place to take Tanky as a model after All-Young?
I also like Olive Young products, so I’m still using them well, but I’m happy every time I hear about Taeyeon and Key’s models and see advertisements.
I really like this combination~~ It's so similar that it goes well with the concept of the advertisement. I think it's great to be able to get a routine just by turning on the app.
Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom's union is the best.. Really tanky brother and sister, please love them a lot in the future ️ It's a really wise choice Thank you very much to the advertiser. Originally, I bought a lot at Olive Young, but if I like models, I can’t afford not to buy them at Olive Young ㅠㅠ I really think I will only buy at All Young in the future.
Every time I pass by the All-Young store, I keep looking at the pictures of Tanky, and I look around for nothing.
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Every time an ad pops up, you put your finger on it so you can't skip it. It's so good!! Let's take more!!
They look very fresh and bright. Perfect choice!!
Ha.. Finally, Olive Young got a job. ㅠㅠ Tanky brother and sister Bonnie & Clyde, who knows who's point of view you did a really great job these days, I'm so happy that these two people I think are the coolest and most amazing are filming a commercial together! In the future, Nolto and Olive Young will have fun with Key X Taeyeon~~️
Tanky, who shows the best combination these days, is doing an All-Young commercial ㅠㅠ It's so good, please show me a better side of you in the future!
What should I do with the tank & key combination ㅠㅠ I really like it.. It's perfect as a model for Olive Young. Looking at it for nothing, I think I'll go to Olive Young to take care of my skin ㅠㅠ
Ah, really tanky bastard ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Every time I pass by Olli Booyoung these days, I see our geniuses, so I smile for no reason ,,, kill me
The day will come when I see a tanky combination at Olive Young ㅠㅠ Isn't this a dream?! As expected, no one can match Olive Young’s senses and senses!!! Originally, I only went to Olive Young, but I had to only go to Olive Young.
Wow, look at how pretty Tanky is, he's really tall, so handsome ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I love you Olive Young, I promise you all my life. That's right, Olyoung is just life.
It's a really great concept, it's so perfect, it seems like Tango Ranky Bum suits him well these days, he didn't even come here, but it feels like he has to go back these days!!! It's great because it's with people who manage well....I love you all....
Kim siblings is a perfect choice for Olive Young
Olive Young... A company that knows how to make money
Best company...! How did you come up with the idea of ​​just using these two?
They're both pretty friendly and everyday images, so the ads aren't even artificial. I admit they're a real genius company
The combination of the two is really the best.. ㅠ ️ My favorite combination! Who in the world denies that the chemistry of the fat brothers and the tanky all-young models is well chosen? Olive Young If you keep working like this, you will only be the best in the universe; Today, I'm going to rob all my wallet in All-Young...
Since it's a tanky combination, it can't get any better than this...! I think it goes well with the concept of Olive Young. I used to go to Olive Young often, but I will listen to it more often in the future. I will open my account to Tanky ....!!!
Could there be such a perfect all-young model?! It's a combination of a tanky who is thorough in self-management and healthy ㅠㅠ I admire All Young's pioneering skills and see the perfect tanky and my forehead is tight today too ㅠㅠ The chemistry between Olyoung, Key, and Taeyeon explodes, so I think positive synergy is working for both Olyoung and Tanky.
I wish I could advertise Tanky All-Young on YouTube every day ㅠㅠ It makes sense to say that this is a tanky all-young combination ㅠㅠ Self-management Manlab is an advertisement for these two, so I believe it.
kibum & taeyeon will be everywhere!!
The real Olyoung knows the trend these days!! Self-management geniuses, Tanky, Olive Young is so good Thank you
Seriously, why isn't there an event like Poca this time? ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I can get away with it all year round ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Originally, I just stopped by often, but now it's so essential that I have to go or turn it on... Hahaha I love Tanky, I've been modeling for a long time.
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh In a time when you can't shop as often as before, if you turn on the app and place an order, delivery is also available, can't it be used? It tastes best when you use what is convenient! won't miss it
Kim Siblings... The people I love who are really good looking and self-managing in a different world ㅠㅠ When I heard the news that I became an All-Young model, I immediately ran over and bought a whole bunch of them ^^ Our Kim brothers and sisters are the best, both in Nolto and All-young!
Tanky.. No one can stop this combination.. People who really care for it are advertised, so they think that models are wearing all-young.. (You can use it for real) Does it look like a young woman if you wear all-young?? Eohu testimonial Olyoung is doing a really good job..
Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-beom All-Young I have a reason to go often!!! The concept fits well with the tanky, and above all, the beauty .. she shines .. Who doesn't like Olive Young !!
I'm just happy to be able to see tanky chemistry in Olive Young commercials.. I'm praising Olive Young's eyes.. I love you All Young Taeyeon Kibum
Olive Young provides something that fits each person's different routines! ㅠㅠ I think it's such a good chemistry! Go or turn on!!
The more I looked at the tanky combination, the more I liked it, but I was so happy to see this combination not only in Nolto but also in Olive Young. Olive young, please take away my wallet
Choosing a real model is a godsend..♡ All-Young is going right away haha
It's really refreshing and it's so cute. It goes well with Olyoung's green.. I hope to see more of Kitaeyeon in the future.
Both of them are very thorough in self-management, and they both have great chemistry and are a tanky I like very much, but since they filmed an advertisement together, I can lie down here. Get rid of all my clogged olive young wallets
What is this trustworthy combination? It's a true legend...
The two of us always thought they were good at taking care of themselves, so I used to do it often. It's so good because it's an image that seems to recommend a life item that I didn't know
kibum got all of us watching an ad in a language we don't understand for products we can't even buy in stores that are not available in our countries
If there is a real Olive Young, it is a sparrow that I do not overlook Long live the minute, health in the in-breath, wealth in the out-breath
I was really worried when Nolto said that Hyeri would be missing, but I was surprised that Taeyeon did so well unexpectedly and showed an unusual chemistry with Key. All-Young who used to be a tanky model is really blessed..
Tanky combination is crazy ㅠㅠ Go or turn it on

Allup Olive Young
I love to see more project from Key & Taeyeon the kim sibling of nolto
Both tankies are so pretty, cool and not joking...
I am just happy to be able to see combinations that I have only seen in Nolto in advertisements!
This is the only ad I see without clicking Skip Ad.
Kim siblings are on another level ♡
It's on TV every day and it's on YouTube, and it's really good.
Last week I went to All Young and wasted my money, but I'm just happy to go shopping while listening to Girls' Generation's SHINee songs..
I'm meeting a friend again next week and I'll go again haha
The concept is perfect, the chemistry is not a joke, and I think I'll pass out because of the two faces..A tanky that's perfect with Olyoung..Bonnie and Clyde....I really want to see them advertise and perform together in the future...I love you Olyoung♡ I love you tanky~~
You can see and buy various products in one place, so the Olive Young store and the Olive Young mobile app have deeply entered my life without me knowing! There's a whole bunch of tanky attached, so even when I'm on the road, I get more attention from the store hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I love you all, I will use you more in the future
I heard that you can meet the steamed brother and sister Chemi Tanky in the Olive Young commercial ㅠㅜ If you follow the fairy Taeyeon and Mokitta Kibeom, it will be like that ㅠㅜㅜ Even though you still pass by and you can hear Olive Young every day, I will take a stamp of attendance. let me meet you
I don't know why I've waited so long since Olive Young's official Instagram came out ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm so happy to see the tanky combination in Allyoung Really Kim Ki-bum The more time passes, the younger I get! Because they are people, I believe in something more ㅠㅠㅠㅠ On the way home, there is an all-younger, but there are posters and stickers on it, so it's snowing every day ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm just so happy ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Let's date Olive Young with me.
Ah, but really tango, how pretty, every advertisement that pops up is awesome. Even the young man’s pizza was full.
Tanky seems to be a positive example of an advertising model. In fact, with a sharp image, good self-management and versatility, I think that they are advertising models that are bound to increase trust and favorability as consumers. I applaud Olive Young, who signed a contract with Olive Young. Please show me a lot of good things in the future.
As a fan who loves Tanky Guild, I am really proud and happy. I hope this ad will make the year even bigger!!
ah… Taeyeon is so pretty... ㅠ Kibum is so cute ㅠ Tanky combination love act is so sweet~ ️
Olive Young is the best.. How did you come up with the idea to use the Tanky Siblings as models??? The concept is so perfect, and the narration of Taeyeon and the key is so good that even after hearing it once, I can't remember how many times I watched the video. I think it's better because there are two models who take good care of themselves, and the tanky chemistry is also not a joke. I love Olive Young. I have used it since the beginning, but I will love and use it more in the future. thank you
Thank you so much Olyoung for using Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon as a model ㅠㅠ It's a combination that I can't hate as a Shawol.
The combination of the two can never go wrong..!!
Olive young you can trust! I'm going to go buy olive young more often in the future.
Me who bought premium to avoid ads.

Also me watching ads with pleasure because it's my almighty KEY ️
I'm really thankful for the two-person advertisement ㅜㅜ Originally I liked All Young, but I think it will get better!! Haha This is my favorite commercial among the ads on YouTube in the middle!! hehe
My favorite combination tanky~>_< Now you can see taengoo often in All Young hehehe My love tangoo is everywhere
From then on, I thought the chemistry between the two was unusual, but...
Starting with Nolto, everyone started to recognize Bonnie & Clyde...!
It is said that the chemistry with the Olive Young model exploded like that ㅠㅠ
I used to like All Young, but now she's in love.
How did you know that Taeyeon’s height is my daily routine and Olive Young put out such a perfect advertisement… ️ Taeyeon-nim, who comes to mind when you think about management, plus Olive Young, a fresh advertisement with all three beats… In the future, let's refer to the Olive Young advertisement for all advertisements. The advertisement sample itself.
Really, thank you so much for modeling with my favorite Kim Ki-beom and Taengoo unnie. I wish you all the best for the Tanky Combination in the future!!
When I saw Nolto, I saw the chemistry between Taeyeon and Kibum, and I was wondering how the chemistry could explode like that, but it's not an advertisement. I want to continue to see this comy in the future
The chemistry between Bumkey and Taengoo Olive Young is so good.. Crazy and so cute ㅠㅠ Every time I watch YouTube, they come out with tangoo and stature, so this is a very good person... Olive Young, Taengoo Key Fight!!
Kim kibum is the best choice for any beauty related cfs
Ah, I think this is a real beauty advertisement.
Just wait for Olive Young because you only have work left to do
The chemistry is so good and the person in charge who made it happen may be filled with happiness ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I really love and love Tanky ㅠㅠ Every time I turn on the All Young app, I get thrilled ㅠㅠ
Real concept artisans TTTTTT It suits him so well, he’s a model for advertising ️️️️
I was very grateful to be able to see Taeyeon, who joined Nolto every week, but thanks to the chemistry between Taengoo and Key, who are active in Nolto, I am so very happy that I was able to film an advertisement at Olive Young like this. The fun of watching Nolto every week + The Olive Young commercials before, during, and after Nolto start are also very lovely. Please continue to be Olyoung who loves our Tango and Nolto a lot~~ I love Olive Young a lot too ^^ Let's go for a long time Olive Young~~~
ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like the tanky siblings ㅠㅠ
You two are really fat brothers.
I'll believe it even if they're twins! lol
It’s a tanky combination, so I usually use Olive Young, but this just means that you have to attend Olive Young every day.. You have to go on or off or attend every day.. Keeping my routine even in Kosi-guk is All Young. As Tanky said, All Young is life. ~ All-Young's best with the commercial model as a tank!! Olyoung takes all of my bankbook
It was a really good place for Olive Young commercials. Tango and Ki-bum were both good at self-management and trendy, plus the Kim brothers and Bonnie & Clyde chemistry shown at Nolto… !! People who can't not like Olive Young are always fond of Olive Young, but I always go and dig it while I go and turn it on.
The tanky combination is really the best Olive Young's eyes are the best Taeyeon unnie Kibeom oppa has the best looks
The chemistry exploded in Nolto, and the two of them filmed a commercial for All Young... I really like this chemistry... How did you know that Ki-bum is a man managed by All-Young seniors and give you such a perfect advertisement... I'm banging on my knees. .. I love you, I love you, I love you Tanky
It's not a cute combination for a day or two, but I added a refreshing touch to All Young! How happy it is to show up 'w'~?! In the past, now and in the future, I will be with Kitang for a long, long time with the built-in Olive Young. >w<)!
Tanky is the model for Olive Young, but he can't go???? I will take attendance stamps.. You did a good job picking the model testimonials… Sobbing
Tanky union, what can you say? Two people who are good at self-management come together and say that Olive Young is life, so I feel like I should make it into a daily life.. In the meantime, the beauty is also great ️ All Young X Tanky Let’s be together for a long time
Kim siblings cf is so fresh! Thank you for choosing them!
The combination is really good.
I really liked Tanky while watching Nolto, but I think it’s amazing that they even filmed an advertisement for Olive Young, my favorite!! It's a pity that Nolto runs once a week, but I'm always excited to wait a week! An amazing Saturday fight that makes it an amazing week! Olive young fighting!! It's a secret that I just ordered shampoo~
To hear that Olyoung and Tanky, who have the perfect image, are advertising ️ You have a really good eye. Still, I stopped by Olyoung often, but the trust is growing more and more.
While watching Nolto, I thought I would like to see more Bonnie and Clyde combinations, but Olive Young even advertised it, so I'm so happy! The concept fits really well, and the chemistry between the two goes well together.
I love Taeyeon x height, so it’s so good to be able to see it in Olive Young too... When you see a poster while passing by Olive Young, everyone makes eye contact and smiles. Oppa the best Nolto the best thank you I love you How do you know that I only go to Olive Young
No matter how much I think about it, I really like it... From her soft and cute voice to the pretty faces of her smiling softly ㅠㅠ It's a beautiful combination that you can't really fall in love with.
I usually go to Olive Young occasionally, but now that Olive Young is a tanky model, I should go more often than before.
Olive Young is really good at testimonials.. I'll go get a bunch of Olive Young stuff soon..
I use Olive Young often and I like it a lot.
Tanky is really the best..︎︎ It was a combination I really liked in Nolto, but seeing these two in an advertisement like this is so good!!!! ㅠㅠ All Young is the best Tanky is the best
Even though I usually go to Olyoung, when I see photos of our Taenggoo and Kibeom on the door of Olyoung, I will go in one more time. I really appreciate Olyoung's perspective.
No, he was thinking of using the world's best self-management kings as models.

You took him from Olive Young. Tanky Everyone has a confident face that everyone can understand, so Olive Young only has a lot of money left to do~~~!!!! If possible, I will love you even more if you make tanky goods,,, hehe Olive Young X Tanky Combination Let's go long
If that's the case with tangu, then that's it.. From now on, 'All Young is Life'!
I don't skip this ad... The chemistry between the two of them is so good and the images match well.
It's a combination I've loved for a long time, but you won't be able to see them filming an ad together.️‍ The harmony of two people who are good at self-management and Olyoung, the best commercial of this era
They both fit perfectly.. Especially green ㅠㅠ You brought the models that are perfect for Olive Young. I will use Olive Young a lot in the future. See, Clyde, Olive Young, fighting
The god of self-management, tanky chemistry is crazy...!! Olive Young is the best cj's daughter, and I will serve her son Tanky and live as a cj slave for the rest of my life... Please continue to ask for more content.
Wow, do they both get prettier as they go on?
I am happy to have seen you since I was born in an era
When I saw this after filming an advertisement, it got to the point where I couldn't even pass it... They're both so pretty TTTTTT
Key is perfect for this kind of cf.
I became a fan while watching Nolto, and even an All-Young advertisement like this!!! Advertisement that makes it impossible not to go all-young ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It’s August’s birthday. All-young takes care of snacks the best. Nolto is the best that guarantees fun every week.
Can't miss the tanky combination~ I appreciate Olive Young's eye. Both came out so pretty ㅠㅠ I watched it for 30 seconds and it seems like my lifespan has increased by 300 years...
The chemistry between the two is no joke ㅠㅠ It's a meeting of Olive Young with two of the best celebrities... I can hear the money coming out of my wallet.. I love you, Taeyeon, and Olive Young, everyone..♡
This model is truly the best ever. Bonnie & Clyde, who is famous for good management, met Olive Young with a unique sensibility and it seems to be the best ever ㅠㅠ My friends are completely uproar ㅠㅠ Every time I walk in, I can't believe she's in her 30s, and Taeyeon is the best.
Our Tango-nim and Ki-beom-nim who fit well together! This ad was chosen pretty well, so even if it comes out on a regular basis, I'm still watching it hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Go Olive Young or turn it on!
As expected, Olive Young knew the trend these days and did a really good job of casting a commercial model ㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠ Really self-management geniuses tanky commercials are so perfect!! I absolutely love you
Very nice chemistry~ Tanky combination is the best!!!!
Taeyeon's beauty, her voice is perfect, she picked it really well
I'm really happy to see Taeyeon Gibeom here, I don't go out often because I'm a housewife, so I couldn't go out often, but I downloaded it right away when I heard that I could go by turning on my phone! I hope these advertising models will never change. I love you.
I've only been waiting for a Bonnie & Clyde collaboration. It's perfect with the self-care king x self-care queen combination. It's so convenient not only to visit Olive Young in person, but also to order through the app! Olive young, who changed my daily routine, is the best ️
I've seen too many commercials so I'm tired of commercials ㅠㅠ It's really fun to be on TV too. If you want to keep my routine, go to Olive Young or turn on Olive Young! Still, I went to Olive Young a lot, but for the time being, I will take a daily attendance check at Olive Young hahaha Kim Ki-beom Kim Tae-yeon the best
Originally, I was using All Young and earning money well, but I like Taeyeon and Key more since they advertised.
It is truly a divine choice to adopt Tanky, the ultimate self-management model, as the model for Olive Young ... Thanks to this, even people without makeup will go all-young ️
Key is really cool and stylish ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like the combination of Key and Taeyeon!! You did a good job... .!!!!!
When it comes to cosmetics, Olive Young is the best when it comes to chemistry, tanky.
Please keep this combination for a long time ~ ** ~
All Young Tank
I really like the tanky combination, but it's great to see you even filming a commercial. Oh, I'm still using it all the time!! To be able to meet Tanky! I wish I could see a variety of things with more content!! I love you tangu gibeom ❤️
I love Tanky ㅠㅠ I'm also going to kill Allyoung. I, who is a three-way person, usually walked around, but I'll have to try the app too hehe Thank you so much for taking good commercials with good models. I also love Nolto, who is very sweet.
Tanky chemistry! It’s a combination I love so much at Nolto, but when they advertise like this, I feel like I go to All Young every day like a sparrow!!
The tanky combination, my favorite combination, is the best.
After seeing the two of them filming a commercial together, why do you press “Excellence in commercials?” I’m in love with Taeyeon’s looks again today ㅠㅠ
Also our Bonnie and Clyde
The tanky combination is the best. I really get along with Olyoung so well ㅠㅠ If Olive Young is just life, then Tanky is just the truth☆
These days, I go all-young to see my sister's face and turn on the app to see Kim Key.
This is paradise on earth... Tanky All Young Forever♡♡
really the best brand
How did you come up with the idea of ​​creating such a combination? I love you really ><
The tanky combination is really cool ㅠㅠ I’ll give you a lot of money from Olive Young ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Both of them really go well with Olive Young ㅠ.ㅠ
Why do you both have such good voices?
I will bury the bones in Olive Young ️
The concept is great! Tanky I think it's good to see this combination anytime!! As a Nolto viewer, it's good that you often show good chemistry. From now on, I'll go to Radu Olive Young often!
She's so pretty and the advertiser's choice is perfectly appropriate ️ Work less and earn a lot, please.
Awesome... Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Both of them look really healthy on the outside and in speed.
Olyoung....thank you for using a real tanky as a model ㅠㅜ Don’t they both go well with Olyoung ㅠㅜㅜ
Key and Taeyeon both have good skin and take good care of themselves, so Olive Young has a more positive image and is more reliable*_* Besides, Taeyeon & Key combination is so good!!!
Watching Nolto and taenggo, I saw that I couldn’t help my height, so I automatically entered it, but I can’t hate it if it’s a combination like this at this time ㅠㅜㅜ
Who is the person who planned this ad, give me a bonus~
All young has a sense for her to open her wallet
I really think this is an advertisement video that sparks the desire to buy.. Management genius king, trust and buy the product used by the two of them hehe Pretty and handsome Tanky Siblings x All Young Long-Long Watch ️️️
Party charging time~ >.< Impressed by the Olive Young advertised by Tanky himself CJ is the best Olive Young that goes and turns on like a habit From now on, I would like to take care of my inner beauty and daily life with Tanky.
At 0:23, I thought she was Tango unnie a goddess..... No, every minute, every minute, every second is a goddess...
Kibum's skin is so good that he has surpassed Everest, and her beauty is beyond heaven.
It makes me happy just to see Noltoro Tanky Siblings every week.
Really, where else can I get a greater emotion than this?
I really hate YouTube ads ㅠㅠ Tanky All Young commercials make me feel better when they come out, so I never skip them... Tanky All Young Forever
Olive Young said I should go in to take a look. She said she liked this last time! uh? Is this what I was buying? It's a terrifying place to spend 50 million won while doing something, but how can even an advertising model use people who are so stupid? I still love Olive Young, but I fell in love with it more... Actually, every Olive Young store has a tanky poster, so I went in and paid for it and came out from a few days ago. I love you Olive Young♡
They both advertise Olive Young by people who are very good at managing them, so they are really trustworthy x 1000000 and their voice suits you so well, you are so pretty, you are so handsome, I love you just ㅠㅠ All young works hard ️‍ Bonnie & Clyde Cooperative I am so grateful to Nolto for letting the world know about it Thanks also to Olyoung for catching this combination and advertising it perfectly. Everyone, Forever.
Tanky doing a great job as a Bonnie & Clyde team in Nolto️‍
The all-young model also digests the concept perfectly.
Kim siblings, who work hard on self-management, are advertising, so her feet are automatically heading towards Olyoung.
If you see a tanky while passing by, you will automatically enter All Young..!
Every time this ad comes out, the corners of my lips just can't come down, so I go through all the ads....I'm so glad I brought people who fit really well with Olive Young ️ Everyone involved in Olive Young, be happy and have a nice day every day. Thank you, we all Olive Young. Let's turn it on~
From today, I will do Olive Young for the rest of my life. Loyalty and Loyalty^^7
Tanky... Casting the two of them Olive Young is a godsend ㅠㅠ
Tanky and Olive Young, why did we only meet now.. Tanky combination is so good..
The tanky siblings are the best ㅜㅜ It's really the best combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Pretty and cute, both of them do it ㅠㅠ
The chemistry between the two of them goes so well and I'm just happy to be able to see them in commercials... Please let our Taengoo and Kibeom serve as models for all-Young commercials for a long, long time...
When it comes to beauty, Tanky Beauty Tanky and Booty Olive Young are the best ️ I'm making a routine recently and I'll use it a lot
Tanky is the best ️️️ They both have similar shades, so it's easy to look at, and the more I look at them, the more I think they picked a model. Hehe I procrastinate every day, but thanks to Tanky, I go to Allyoung and get 10 mana of basic products.
I really love Tanky Guild ㅠㅜㅠ It's so perfect. I'm signing a permanent contract with Olyoung right now.
Taeyeon Ki Taeyeon, two people who are good at advertising, and two people who are good at advertisements, Olyoung, who made a trendy and sophisticated advertisement by going to Delgo, is so smart... We will take responsibility for the purchase.. Thank you for your insight ㅠㅠ
Tanky combination that you can trust and see ㅠㅠbb Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde is so good that you came as an advertising model. Tanky who is always the best for self-management is the best!!!! I, who used to only purchase offline, saw this video and installed the app. Tanky let's win and win, let's go!
The images of Olive Young and the models are really perfect ㅠㅠ
It's really perfect; It's so good that I can see the Kitang siblings often ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Thank you for using me as a model ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I will love and use them more all the time.
Tanky brother and sister combination is the best ♡♡♡♡
I believe it more because people who are the best in self-management, inside and outside, advertise.
olive young

I support the X Tanky siblings ~~~~
It's a good advertisement with a good concept and peace of mind...
Good pick Key and Taeyeon ️
No, I don't know why Key and Taeyeon and Olive Young's models go so well together ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ In fact, people who seem to use Allyoung a lot are advertising, so I feel more trustworthy.
Olive young is just life
Tanky has a good variety show combination, but what if the advertisement combination is also good? At Olive Young, you can experience everything related to routine, from skin to hair to life and food.
The chemistry between Tanky and Olive Young is forever!!!!
The meeting between Tanky and Olive Young is just a legend.. ㅠㅠ I will go to Olive Young every day or turn it on!!
It's really perfect ㅜㅜ Now I go here more often
It's so good to see the chemistry between the two of them, which I only saw in Nolto, in Ohyeong~ (˘▽˘~) (~˘▽˘)~ I usually go often, but I will go more often in the future (σ^∀^)σ I look forward to the chemistry between the two in the future. to the fairies
I want to buy everything Kibum is using ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like the tanky combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I love you, Tango unnie ㅠㅠ Your height is so perfect.. I really like this advertisement ㅠㅠ You do a really good job all year round ♡♡♡♡
Wow, this is an advertisement ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm going to have to go buy Olive Young,,️
How many times do you watch a 30-second commercial video ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's so cute, I love you so much. You picked the perfect model for yourself. You've served the kings of self-management. The thing I admire the most is that they are all-young people who are more serious about tanky than anyone else,,,, I will admit...!
Tanky is love...♡ These are models that fit the brand perfectly. They are the best in all young years. They are smart and spunky. Tanky recommends them, so I feel more trustworthy and I think I should go shopping for Olive Young right now.
Ha, isn't All Young selected as an advertising model as a tanky combination a genius? Now I won’t go lalavla. Go Olive Young three times a week. I also buy snacks at All Young. I’ll add olives even when I go to Subway. Even when I eat pizza, I eat without olives!! Please let our kids be advertising models for a long time ️️️
She's really cute and she's so cute... I go there often, but these days, whenever I pass by, two bright faces come to mind, so I go in whenever I see him... That's the importance of an advertising model... Ha...
The world's favorite tanky combination
It's a tanky combination. Thank you so much, All Young.
To be honest, I'm a person who always wears makeup without applying basic products because I'm always too bothered, but these days, thanks to Tanky and All Young, I've started applying foundation again hahahaha
I didn't go to All Young to buy it, but I'll have to go and buy everything I want to buy soon.
This is an excellent choice for a real teacher.
Taeyeon & Key's combination is so good, to come out with my favorite Olyoung ㅠㅠ This is love
I thought the chemistry between the two of them in Nolto would be completely broken, but I was surprised to see an advertisement on Allyoung. Thanks to these two tanky chemists who even recognize cancer advertisers, I think we'll be going there often~~
Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom's concept is perfect
These geniuses... To be able to digest anything like this... Tanky combination is really love,,,♡
Even when I went to Olive Young for sale, I didn’t know what it was, so it was my daily routine to just look around.. I go to the store more often to see the tanky poster, and if I need something, I go search for Olive Young’s recommended items and buy it.
Thank you so much for using me as a tanky model♡♡ㅠㅠ
Kim sibs chemistry is no joke
Tanky is here. It's Ollibu-yong~ Shooting an advertisement !! They both seem to be smart and take good care of themselves, and they also like to decorate their houses, so I think it goes well with the Olive Young advertisement! I was a favorite idol when I was young, but I feel like an older brother who is good at taking care of myself, I want to imitate him, and he made an Olive Young commercial so I felt close for nothing. Tanky All Young Forever
Molang glutinous rice cake, what should I do ㅠㅠ Inside and outside, day and night, I love the tanky combination..
Lovely tanky, I really love you, advertiser..♡♡ Tango and tall are so pretty
The image of Bami and Olyoung are so perfect
Tanky is the best ️ It's managed so well these days, people who are renewing the series every day are advertising All Young, so it's a bit credible.. It's a bit vague to go out these days, but it also highlights the advantages of having an app, so I feel like I want to install it even after erasing my insufficient capacity!!
A tanky combination you can trust!! I believe in Olive Young's eyes Hehe The tanky brothers and sisters who are known for taking good care of them are acting as commercial models, so they want to buy more, go and turn on.
I really love Ha Tanky Combination Heukgyu Heukgyu
But All-Young is real life.. If there is nothing to do, I trudge away, and if I find something I like there, I will buy it again, I will buy it while I am there, and I will buy it, etc. I really like this model ㅠ ️
I like tanky..♡
I really like wearing pink and blue alternately..
I love you ♡♡
This world is brighter thanks to you
Tanky union pros cons pros cons pros cons!! I was so happy to see the Olive Young commercial!! I will always support you, fighting!
Olive Young is the best.. ㅠㅠ I saw the two of them a lot at Nolto, so I know they're close, and both of them have good skin, so it's nice to see advertisements like this,, ㅠ When I need cosmetics, I'll go to Olive Young!!
Thanks to Bonnie & Clyde, I got a lot of interest in Olive Young hahaha!! I'm passing by and I'm listening to Olive Young
Great approval for this combination.. What's going on with your face ㅜㅜ Pretty people and pretty people.. This is a complete stun.. kijul (:3」∠)
Ugh Kibeom oppa is this a true story these days ㅠㅠㅠㅠ He's so handsome, Tango unnie, what are you going to say TTTT Really meeting my favorite female idol in one place, let's walk only on the flower path from now on
Really tanky TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT I love Olive Young
I'm here ㅠㅜ Finally an advertisement for Tanky
No, it's a concept like this right?
Why do you eat so much?
Thank you for the video of Tanky All Young.
It's so nice to see two people who work hard to manage an advertisement. Do you feel like you want to copy them?
The chemistry between the two is very good, and it seems like they picked a really good model this time around. These days, I see a lot of places that use models that I hate to buy, but I feel like I've finally seen an advertisement like an advertisement...
Precious tanky chemistry... All-Young did it!! When you see this commercial on TV, the boring commercial becomes so much fun! I liked Olive Young, but I will like it even more in the future. See you for a long time, Tanky! See you soon, Olive Young!
I really like the tanky combination, I like Olyoung's green and green color and the model and the image look good together ㅜㅜ Even her tall skin makes her want to buy cosmetics, so I think it's the best
The advertisement models were chosen very well, and the advertisements were also selected very well.
When it comes to Allyoung, first of all, one person enters the store. Thanks to Tanky, I tour Allyoung very close to my house every day hehe And whenever I visit the store, I look at the poster and I feel happy.
Taeyeon is so pretty when she blows her hair out at the ending~ Really heart-fluttering.... ㅠㅠ She's so pretty even with her pink hair~
It seems like the ad was chosen so well, so I feel good about it hahahahahahaha It seems like Olyoung is really good at choosing an ad model! very good
Both of them are so pretty and handsome, there is no time to turn my eyes elsewhere I love you, Tanky Siblings••️
I found the ad for the first time and saw it hahaha I really like the tanky combination haha
The tank combination is so good ㅠㅠ The concept suits you so well, I need to go to Olive Young more often
Being a tall all-young model,,,,, I really like it ️
I can't lose the tanky combination ㅠㅠ Advertisers who picked this combination, be happy for the rest of your life... The versatile tanky really goes well with the image of Olive Young, a collection of everything ㅠㅠ His beauty is also gracious ㅠㅠ
I put the tank on the left and right so I don't know where to put my eyes, so I'm watching the 309923th
Take responsibility!!! Take responsibility for my routine and take responsibility for all of my heart and wallet that I lost to All Young ㅠㅠ
Kim Tae-yeon × Kim Ki-beom Kim brother-in-law's union is the best. Anyway, I watch Taeyeon's video and it's so good when Taeyeon commercials come out. I really like the combination of Koduk Taengoo, Ki Beom, who is strict with self-management, and Olive Young.
I thought the chemistry was really good in Nolto, but I think the chemistry in the commercials goes well too. Fighting in the future
After Tanky became an advertising model, I went there more often. If I see it, I will definitely go in.
SHINee songs are also available at the store, and Olive Young has a great sense!!!
You can turn on the app and receive fast delivery with Today's Dream, or you can go to Olive Young anywhere in the country to quickly get what you need, and the best Olive Young ️
The commercials also seem to come out beautifully, and above all, I love that Kibum can see them when I turn on the TV!!
It's really the first time that an ad model and an ad match so well ㅠㅠ How is it that an ad is so attractive ㅠㅠ It's the first time I've been to an ad after searching for an ad ㅠㅠ It's really great ㅠㅠ
I really like Tanky Guild, but Adjunct Olive Young really makes a lot of money ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I saw a real ad and rose to a clown, so I laughed like this hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Wait a minute. I have to give you some money!!!!! I really love you Olive Young....
Advertising really has a sense of humor, only women take care of their appearance, men eat nutritional supplements every day and get tired of exercising.
Haha, the combination of the two is perfect.
I really like the advertisement The characteristics of Olive Young, both offline and online, are perfect at a glance! I can see it >.< The best thing about tanky is that it shines...ᰔᩚ I need to run to the Olive Young near my house right now️‍ I love you tanky~ᰔᩚ
It suits you really well, tanky
It's the first time I've seen Yeonyan who is so perfect for an All-Young model.
It looks better because the kings of management are advertising it I love you Tanky
I'll go and turn on Olive Young and I'll do whatever it takes ㅠㅠ Tango unnie.. You're so pretty!! Tanky combination is very ~~ I like it ~~
Olive Young.. wait.
. I'll shake it all off ;) Tanky both are so good
It's a collaboration between Tango and Kibeom ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ Tang Gibeom who works hard for all his facial beauty ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ️️️️ Thank you Olive Young for all the routines in the world
I really like Tanky Guild, it's so good to meet you at Allyoung, I think I've got another reason to go to Allyoung!!! Best all-young best tank
I love Taeyeon and Key, thank you Olive Young
Really watching the tanky commercial ㅜㅜㅜㅜ I'm so happy with the combination TTTT Thank you to the staff TTTT
It's Olive Young advertising, but it's so funny that the event is held at Nolto... hahahaha Oh, anyway, because it's the same CJ, congratulations to the Kim Nam-mi and All-Young models, I'm happy to see a tanky face every time I go. Taste Olyoung Nolto Kim brother and sister live long
To say that there are models like this in the world, he is thorough in self-management and every time he sees it, he is a tanky whose skin glows so much that I wonder what product he uses, but it really suits All Young
Bonnie & Clyde Huay Tang ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Concept Wanjoni Perfect rice cake (っ’-‘)╮=͟͟͞͞♡ ꧁♡꧂
No, these people... What would you do if the commercial chemistry was good ㅠㅠ Isn't it a human Olyoung... The real Olyoung is just life and my love
I believe even more when an idol who has been running for more than 10 years says so ㅠㅠ️
The real people involved in the tanky union, please accept me Taeyeon unnie is getting prettier every day ㅠㅠㅠㅠ As expected
People who believe like this
How nice it is to advertise ~~ Beom-ah, I will go to Olive Young often ️
He showed various appearances with Nolto, etc.
Congratulations to Taeyeon and Key!!
And it's great to see the chemistry through the commercials ^^
I love you... So pretty... How did you decide to cast these two together How do you know if I like this chemistry...♡ The commercial video doesn't end right now It's a 30-second video, but I keep seeing it, Advertiser of the Strongest Tanky Guild Thank you for allowing us to see Tanky together. Advertiser I love you, I love you Tanky!!!
Trusted Tanky Combination Thanks to the thorough self-management tanky in the image you usually show, your trust in Allyoung is also increased. Thank you for your hard work.
As soon as I saw this, my first thought was 'All young has a sense' It's a real tanky combination that you can't help but fall in love with ㅠㅠ
Take my heart, take my money, take it all
It's refreshing because Tanky is advertising.
Olive Young has permeated my daily life like a tanky.
ㅎ ㅎ ㅎ I will cry well, I will go to the olive English. I promise to go.
As someone who uses All Young so well, and as someone who watches and watches Nolto every day, I love all these combinations..
They both have a lot of similarities, so the models are perfect and the concept is very well made, so the kids look cooler, so Kibum is happy as a Shawol model, and Sowon would like Taeyeon to be the model? I love you all young, come all young~
Taeyeon and Koduk are the tallest models for self-management, so you can’t go without Olive Young, right? Ah, I saw the advertisement and threw away the items I put in the shopping cart. The effect of the tanky advertisement is the same. If you want to increase your olive young money, it would be better to keep this combination for a long time.
"Participation completed"

Thank you for making us a company that promotes your products. Also, thank you for the sweepstakes you organized. I'm enjoying watching the ad.
Advertisement with two tanks, an official who can't be seen at that age... . oh my god… .. All-Young desire to purchase soars
I still had something to buy, but seeing several commercials being uploaded, I want to purchase even the ones I didn't originally buy ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Aww, pretty, pretty ㅠㅠ
The model was really well chosen.
I really like the chemistry between the two of you. How did you know Olyoung and cast Taeyeonkey?
Whenever you pass by Olive Young, you can't just pass by when you see a picture of Tanky back to back ㅠㅠ Olive Young is so amazing~~
A combination I believe in and watch Tanky is so pretty, every time I see Nolto, I hear a gasp when I see an ad. A face that never gets tired of looking at it A heart-fluttering voice Oh I like Tanky, I love you all, you do your best at your job.
All-Young did a good job! Oh my God, the people who are so pretty, handsome, and well-managed are advertising Olive Young and it makes me want to go there.... When I entered Olive Young, I went to buy one, but I picked up another one, put it in the basket, and paid for it... hehe I've never always bought one.....hehe The concept is perfect and the tanky goes well with Olive Young ️
Those who know the chemistry between Taeyeon and Key know that it is a real combination
Kibum looks so cool and cutie
They really are the best..
I really feel like my eyes are cleansed when I see All Young commercials.. I feel more comfortable when I see this after watching a strange Chinese game commercial..
Taeyeon Kim I took a picture of a legend with pink hair, but at the end, when I saw my pink hair fluttering in the wind, it made my heart flutter. Taeyeon Gibeom Guild is like watching a fat brother, so I can enjoy watching advertisements ㅠㅠ
I usually liked Tanky Cammy on YouTube or Nolto, but now when I go out, I always stop by All Young, even if I have nothing to buy.
The different care routines of the Kim brothers and sisters who resemble each other because they are Olive Young Models who make it more difficult to decide whether to go or turn on Olive Young
I really like Taeyan the key!!! The chemistry is really amazingly beautiful ^^
Not only in Nolto, but also in Olive Young, the two people who are close to each other are love.
Tanky is so musical genius, entertainment genius, advertising genius
Just the two of us!!!!
Kyaaaah~~ Tanky ㅠㅠ The concept is so perfect
I really like the tanky combination.
Olive young every day ㅜㅜ Ha happy eyes, tanky is so desirable
I really like the tanky tanky combination ㅠㅠ Advertisers~ Please take good care of me as an advertising model in the future~!!~!!
All-Young, who uses the current idol's best combination tank as a model, is happy that she will often go to All-Young in the future for this generation's most discerning brand.
How did you choose the model so well~!! All-Young is just life! Aww so cute ㅠㅠ I love you Tanky
It suits you so so so so so so so good and is the human Olyoung (?) itself ㅠㅠ Tanky is always right!! Now I have to go to All Young and check in every day.
What do Olive Young and Kim Siblings' union say .... Let's go to Olyoung and listen to her Kim and Sibling Pleas and bring them all together! It's a secret that my wallet gets stolen
Seeing the tanky combination here as well, I think it fits the concept perfectly.
aww i am so happy they have this haha
Taeyeon is sooo beautiful if she's using Olive Young to get her her beauty products then count me in
The tanky chemistry is really the best Olive young that came up with this combination Work less and earn more!!
Thank you so much for the Tanky Guild ㅜㅜ I'll work harder on Olive Young ㅠ♡
Olive Young's dazzling eyes pound her head and admire her
You know what the tanky union people like these days, and I really love you a lot. I love you Olyoung.
Can you see the world's best youngest brother and sister tanky union in Nolto as Bonnie & Clyde in All Young? Olyoung is definitely full of genius...Thanks to the advertiser...Olive Young is definitely the number one company that does the best job in the world... ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I really like you ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Tango and Gibam are the same ㅠㅠ Kim Ki-beom, cj son, let's go
The combination is crazy..
A fresh tanky.... Isn't the sibling combination so good~~~
These lovely Kim brothers and sisters~~ Every time I see them on TV, I am so proud of them ♡ Olive Young, run now ~ >_<
Ha, what a lovely combination... Tanky is so lovely, cute, fluffy and cutie••• It means I love you. The concept is perfect and I really love you. Guys, it's really pretty.
Perfect Taeyeon x Key ad They both look soooo good together!
Thank you to Olive Young students.. I know how to go to Olive Young when I am bored every day and thank you
Our Kibum and Taeyeon are both so pretty and lovely ㅠㅠ They are perfect with Olive Young. I'm going to buy them right now.
It's a combination of tangoo & kibam, I can't tell you~~ Olive Young used to come in and out often, but I have to come in and out more often. The best advertisement for the best model combination.
It's a tanky union ㅠㅠㅠ I'm lying here with a crown. I'm really fat and I'm kind of like Taeyeon unnie and Kibeom oppa, so I'm so glad to see the ad. I feel like I need to turn on All Young right away or go. I don't know who the best marketing team for All Young is or where you are, but I'll put it up there. Thank you for doing it Olive Young
Taeyeon, who is usually good at taking care of herself, is advertising All Young..Aren’t you going to be exhausted without shopping every day? This TTTT Those who planned Olive Young’s commercials Those who brought tankies I love you very much Work less and earn more money Please keep more content in the future I love you Tanky Combination
There is a reason why Olive Young is doing well, the fact that the tanky brother and sister are used as advertisement models shows how well they understand the latest trends. I became a happier person to spend money on
Wow, what the hell, why is the ad so cute ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Kibum and Taeyeon's concept and atmosphere fit so well. People who are passionate about managing other women come out and advertise, so they'll be driven to All Young to work harder.
I'm really happy that Tanky did an All-Young commercial ️
It’s no exaggeration to say that I really cried while watching the ad.. Tanky are people who are good at managing tanks from the beginning, but when they say they filmed an All-Young commercial, I believe something more. first generation
To be able to see the tanky brother and sister union outside of Nolto.. I love Allyoung. I've never used the Allyoung app, but I'll install it now and try it!
Allyoung is the best. Thank you for liking our tanky
Power in your breath. Get health in your breath

draft poem
Let's be together for the rest of our tanky~
I ran to Taeyeon because she was so pretty after watching the ad... .. sooooooo pretty
I really love Olive Young, who used Tanky as an advertisement model. I am ready to support all of my fortune.
One ad model was chosen amazingly All-Young
Tang Ki-bum is so pretty ㅠㅜ I miss Olive Young every day..!!
Why did you only use Tango and Kibeom as models.... You did really well.
A tanky combination you can trust and see,,,☆ Doesn't it look perfect with Olive Young?! I love how they look so good together, I'm running out of cream, but I'll have to turn on Olive Young!
Thank you for being born, Tango.
I love the tanky olive young combination so much I feel like I'll have white and clear skin like a tanky if I buy it from Olive Young~ It's a combination that makes you feel good just looking at it!!
The Bedlington Terrier that Taeyeon is hugging is our dog, but the filming has finally come out, so proud ️
It goes so well with Tanky Allyoung ️️️
I wanted Kibum to film an advertisement, but finally! It must be worthwhile for Ki-bum to take good care of his skin.
I hope Tanky and All Young do even better. Let’s hit the jackpot
Kibum,,, I was surprised at the first to see that I was taking care of my skin more meticulously than I did in Mt. Nahon. I was surprised the second time when I heard that it was going to show after 20 years, but I was surprised the third time when I saw the advertisement. Tanky who believes and sees... .. I'm going to buy it!!!
The advertisement model is so perfect!!! Kim brother and sister commercial

They are both kings of management, so I think it would be perfect for all-young products too ^//^

I usually go here often because I'm Koduk, but I feel like I'll go more often to listen to the tanky songs I hear at the store!!

I'm going to buy cosmetics that we use together...
Tanky is the best because it's an ad model that's perfect for All Young,,, I really want to go to All Young and buy all the products that Tanky recommends ㅠㅠ Tanky is the best!!!!!!! The person who suggested it as an ad model tank is a real genius ㅠ
I've been watching a 30-second video for 30 minutes....? The tanky combination is perfect, I love you, everyone, Olibu-yong Oh-so-oh-se-yong !!!!!!!!!!!!
Stunned by tango wink
The combination of Bam and Tanggoo's faces is so pretty.......Lovely....Cute...
Every time we pass by Olive Young, our eyes meet so Joha... I love you all year... I think we will go more often..
Your voice is really good! I am so happy to be advertising Olive Young.
All Young is life, Tanky is love. For makeup products, Olive Young spends tens of thousands of won every month, so I often go to Olive Young and my favorite artists are models!!!!!!! Olive Young Praise I love you Thank you
Taeyeon, Kibum... the combination is the best + Olive Young = What do you say?
The video is very pretty and the voice suits you the best ㅠ_ㅠ...
The perfect model Delco on Olive Young is the best
A person who didn’t know about going to Olive Young realized through Tanky CF that there was an Olive Young app, and now she can choose between going to Olive Young or turning it on!!! Thanks to Tanky, I can get closer to Olive Young, so it's great.
0:22 Isn't Taeyeon crazy.... It's windy, but it's such a pretty thing??
It's perfect with the All-Young concept. The two models who work hard on self-management are models, so trust is up ️️ Go All-Young or turn it on~! Namjoahyeong because it is easily available
Olive young teachers~~ Making or... NG vowels... Is there no such thing?
Oh really, the two of them have the perfect image with Olive Young ㅠㅠ Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon's face is the best...
Heh..ㅠ It's really, really, it's such a perfect match ㅠㅠㅠㅠ How pretty and handsome ㅠㅠ
The tanky combination is always right.
Thank you so much for being a model for All Young's commercials ㅠㅠ
All young, prepare to receive my wallet!♡
I really love you
Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-bum, the perfect cast for All-Young!!!! From Nolto's brother and sister cami to the kings of management!! There's even a picture of a tanky in All Young that I can't just ignore though... Take my money ㅠㅠ
Both are celebrities who are very good at taking care of themselves, and Taeyeon is a celebrity who even showed her all-young swept on tangoo TV, so they fit together so well and I like it.
Something goes well with the image of Olive Young
I'm watching a 30 second ad 30 times in 30 minutes.. Good luck this year ㅠㅠ♡
I saw Olive Young commercials..
The two most memorable of All Young’s advertising models ㅜㅜ They’re the best
I didn't know that my favorite would be an All-Young advertising model ㅠㅠ
Tango and Kibum go so well with Olyoung ㅕ..
Even if Ki-bum sees it, I have to go there at least once..!!
I've been aware of it ever since my new kid kept sending olive emoticons with a bubble, and the concept is perfect... The tanky combination is perfect!!!! The freshness of tanky is added, so it goes well with Olive Young's brand image.
Pretty and talented Kims
I am completely in favor of this union to put Key Taeyeon's chemistry on Olive Young.
All young fighting
I go there a lot when buying cosmetics or perfume, but this model is tanky?! I can't go without this... The tanky combination in the ad is perfect
I still miss the tanky combination ㅠㅠ All young perfect!!
The image that matches the tanky brother and sister All-Young life so well.. You picked a good ad model testimonial~~ All-Young that can be accessed online or offline for any lifestyle is great,,
Tango who works out every morning... Please work hard instead of me.
The reason why the last video of Taengoo TV is going to Olive Young.
After all, the cami doesn't change anywhere. A tanky that fits the image of Olive Young! Good luck.
Nolto fighting
0:24 I love it 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
What to do with the concept ㅠㅠ These Nolto brothers and sisters ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like it.. Olive young, take my whole..
I am so happy that Nolto Bonnie and Clyde also filmed a commercial together. Please continue to show good chemistry in the future!
All young has chosen all the advertising models and concepts well!
Both of them are strict with self-management and are beautiful.
Goes well with Olyoung, the king of beauty!
It can be used even if it is a different routine, so it becomes everyone's routine, and if you want to keep the routine, you will go to Olive Young! Olive young is a real life...I also use Olive Young often! I buy a product from Olive Young and use it every day, and I love that Olive Young sells a variety of products! But Taeyeon and Tall are advertising Olive Young... I'm really happy
I like to go on and off, and the phrases are good. Most of all, the models do a good job. It goes by in 30 seconds.. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
The Barbie and Ken of kpop ladies and gentlemen
A model that fits the theme of routine so well!!
Tango and Kibum are all-young models.

Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde are all-young models, so it's perfect Synergy is no joke!
All I have to do now is to spend more money at All Young

Don't you know that the concept is so perfect... The two fit so well
No, I thought who was going to catch the tank.
I'm so proud that Olyoung showed up like this and left!!
I don't know who planned it, but I really love it
You made the advertisement so well that the tanky's appearance doubled!! I think it shines more because it is taken with a comfortable feeling!!
0:21 Oh really pretty Kim Taeyeon
As the combination is perfect, it makes even my skin into honey rice cake.
What's the tank combination?
The fact that you are filming an advertisement with a legendary brother and sister union that explodes in chemistry is truly all-younger
All-Young is also responsible for my routine ~~~~
Look at Kibum's skin... It's really so amazing ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Taeyeon is so pretty too!!!!!!!!!!!!
If Taeyeon and tall two of them, who show her brother and sister chemistry in Nolto, film an Olive Young commercial like this, I can't go all the way again hehe I'll run ️️
Thank you so much omg ㅠㅜㅜㅠ ㅇㅆ in front of the house I will say “go” every day
It's an advertisement, it's a pictorial, just one thing ㅠㅠ It's so pretty
The two of them are so all-young models, the chemistry in Nolto is so good, I hope they both have more fun in the future!!!!
Aaaaah!! ㅠㅠ
Ha, really, tangoo is so pretty... ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon really sound good..
The best tanky The tanky look that stands out from a distance makes Olive Young's presence more alive~~~ If you see it on the street, you want to enter it immediately and get off even if you drive past it.
When Noltoboda's Olive Young commercial came out, I was really moved and ecstatic beauty
Kim Ki-beom, Kim Tae-yeon, Olive Young, Nolto, I love you all
Tanky is just love... I'm so happy to be able to see the Tanky siblings every time I go these days.,,,

Tanky concept is perfect
The kings of self-management are models.
Where is the head of public relations team Olyoung?!

I got a comment dollar again because of the Nolto event!! Key oppa All Young's ad is so well done!! (Taeyeon unnie too) My older brother advertises that I go to see each other every night after school these days.. I was wondering if I could get one when I replace the poster (?). I love you Kim Ki-beom ️
How do you know that Kim and brother are the best combination these days... It's perfect with All-Young
crazy crazy... It's not a joke from the tanky combination, it's a perfect combination, but he said that he did a good job even if he casted well... You're trying to steal all my money... ㅠㅠ Just tanky? I tore it all apart by its very existence... There is a woman who fell while crying because she liked it so much that she only watched the video??? That person is me... ~
Dressed in black olives, her shoulders and the corners of her lips are raised.

It's good that Gibam took the All Young commercial, isn't it a tanky combination?! I'm crazy, really, please accept me as an advertiser ️
If you take the kids who follow the testimonial routine and manage them, you have to model them to get your image up!!
But I'm so proud that my kids are so model-like I'm going crazy ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Good job Olyoung testimonial I'm on a 20-day salary, so I'll just have to wait, I'm going to use up my bankbook.

I went to Olive Young 2 years ago and didn't come back, but I came back like this..
Nolto's best sibling chemistry couple ㅠ 0ㅠ Everyone is a Bon2B professional idol, so the advertisements are full of talent. Both of them are well-known for beauty and trendy images, so they are perfect with Olyoung! I got the All Young model so well!
The best chemistry I found out thanks to Nolto ㅠㅠ How do you think of advertising with the two of you ㅠㅠ Olive Young is the best
Before that, I saw a picture of Tango taking a picture in front of Olive Young in Myeong-dong and did what I did, but I became an All-Young advertising model.
It was a shame to only see Tanky Chemi Nolto, but to be with you all year long, Hambokki
K-pop Thecoo's heart is magnified to select an advertisement model with this combination.. Tanky combination is the best in summer. Olive young automatically makes you want to enter.
Go or turn on? i do both
Because Olive Young is love
Because Wool Tanky is the model!!!
What is this combination..what..I absolutely support this combination! Bonnie and Clyde forever! Tanky is so cool, pretty and both of us do it all! Testimony! In that case, you can only do space conquests!!
K-pop emperor Bonnie and Clyde All Young has also been taken over!! All Young teachers, please take my humble wallet and leave a lot of beautiful images of the two of them... ️
To hear that Tanky is filming an All-Young commercial..♡ You can see Tanky as an All-Young commercial. As someone who really loves the Nolto Tanky combination, I can’t stand it without being happy..♡♡ I always love All-Young, Tanky, and Nolto too♡♡♡
The tank combination is so good.. I really like it all..
I don't know who the Kim Siblings Tanky All-Young model is, but thank you.
His skin is soo good
The tangoo, height, and chemistry were the best, but I didn't know they would even shoot an advertisement like this... I'll have to go to Olive Young again... Everyone, let's go to Olive Young or turn it on, and let's increase our sales this year ^-^
Even if the routine is different from mine, I will match everything Kibum Taeyeon-ah ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I love you Kim brother and sister
Seeing these two makes me want to take care of my health and live my life with care. You chose the model really well.
Ha, it’s a key combination with tango. Manager, it’s so perfect with Olyoung in the world, two people who are passionate about self-management are not the same. I can't just pass by because my best friends are with me
I really want to do it too... ..I'll make you key right away Olive Young... .Olive Young, or where can I buy cosmetics and skin toner foam?
You were very determined to do well in Olive Young's business.
Tanky combination is the best testimonial, but what about this all-young? Did you decide to eat the whole world all over the world, wait all the time, I'll be there soon ️
Olive Young, the best discerning, the best tanky
Models who use All Young often, but increase the desire to purchase even more! Tanky goes really well with Olive Young.
I'll go right now
There's a big poster at the entrance and it's so pretty!!
They're both really pretty and handsome... The one who told me to do it as a tanky model, work less and make a lot of money. Models that fit really well.....ᐟ.ᐟ.ᐟ ️️
The two's chemistry and the concept fit perfectly!
Absolutely great big hit... I love you oppa ㅠ ㅠ
Kim Ki-beom has a handsome face and a good-looking voice.
Nolto's best output, that's tanky Bonnie & Clyde TTㅠ I watched Nolto every week and got caught up in it.
I stopped by the car to participate in the Nolto event,,,,ㅜㅜ As expected, the beauty of the two seems to be Korea's welfare and insurance.
It's nice to see the synergy between Nolto and Allyoung too!!! haha
Ait Mollang Nolto Allyoung~ I will love you even more in the future~^^
The tanky combination is the best...you are dignified ㅠㅠ Both the night and the tank are so cool ️
The tanky combination is the best.. Olive young is so perfect!!
Olive young, who recognized the perfect tanky combination.. I love you cj ㅠㅠ I'm going to rob you of my money ^^ Thanks to you, I've installed the app and skip all the ads.
Now I only have to go to Olive Young~ I can’t leave out when Ulgibami advertises ‘w’
Olive Young is life~ If you want to be young, you should apply Olive Young products
Taeyeon and Key's sibling chemistry is still the best.
Day and night ~ 24 hours 365 days like Olive Young’s routine
We will take the lead for youthful skin!!!!!!!
I can't live without Olive Young, but every time I go to All Young, there is a tank on the door so I love it. Give my wallet to Ol Young right away
I love you tangu tangoo
Advertising with this combination!! It's really the best. I think I'll go to Olive Young more often in the future! Really great as a model
Tanky said he's modeling for an advertisement, so after a long time I cleaned up my cosmetics and went to buy skin lotion and various things. After that, I've been going often!! Thank you for being our tanky as a model.. Every time I go to the All Young store, I love it and die
The siblings I love the most are the Tanky siblings.
Tanky All Young's ad suits you so well... The strongest youngsters who take good care of themselves ️️️️️ Praise All Young!!
Kim Ki-beom oppa!!!! I'm going crazy, I want to run away and sweep it away
Taeyeon and Key showed off their crazy sibling chemistry in Nolto and even won an advertisement for Olive Young, Asia's best drug store!! With the two of you, my day should also start with Ollie and end with Byoung. I'm going to go take a look now.

The tanky combination of truth!!!
Taeyeon is so pretty ㅠㅠ
The meeting of Choi Ae and Choi Ae, Tanky, this combination is the best of all wins.
You look younger than me.
It's Olive Young, which I used to go to often, but thanks to the combination of the two, I'll go there often ㅋㅋ I went in to escape the heat, but when SHINee's Soshi Kibum and Taeyeon's songs come out, my ears are good and I buy things without realizing it.. Praise the combination of Olive Young and Tanky..
Tanky Siblings! very good~
We are lucky to live in an age where we can see advertisements like this.
Both tankies are used as Olive Young models.
Olive young is the best... . Jin
The image of Olyoung and young Tanky is so perfect... My wallet is ready, so let's be together with Tanky for a thousand years, God All Young

Using two people who work hard for self-management as models, trust is definitely rising.
Tanky combination is so cool, once you fall in, you can't come out... Every time I go, I see the two of them, so cute, pretty and handsome. I didn't go there often, but I go often these days because of Tanky >_< Work less and make a lot of money
I use Olive Young every day for basic cosmetics, diet products, and even snacks. As a self-proclaimed All-Young fan, I think Tanky is a customized model for All-Young!! Together, the two of us, the refreshing pack, the honey combination, tanky forever ^^
We miss our Vermi Tang ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's so perfect!!!! It's perfect that our tanky is an all-young model!

It seems that there are people at Olive Young who have excellent talents in advertising model selection. I'm looking forward to the endless development in the future hehe Our tanky advertising genius really...
No, yes, why did our kids only meet Olyoung now? ☆*
The perfect ice cream, Mochi and Sesame-like tanky and Olyoung are so pretty and just a light, Olyoung was life. Life... ! ㅠ 0 ㅠ
I love my brother and sister Kim so much, but thanks to Olyoung, I'm so happy that I can see more of them ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Every time I see pictures or advertisements, my mom is smiling.
I really, really, really love Tanky. Olyoung is doing a great job. To use the final bosses of self-management as models..!
Taeyeon's voice is really cute. It sounds like your voice is coming out when you dub
Oh brother Kim's face is amazing, her face is amazing
Every time an advertisement appears on TV, I am very happy, Olive Young is the best, Tanky is the best
They fit perfectly, Bonnie & Clyde is the best ㅠㅠ
Tanky is a combination that I really like very much, and Olive Young is a cosmetic brand that I like very much, but I am the happiest now.
I really like this combination. I will continue to use Olive Young!!!
Thinking of choosing Taeyeon and Key, who are synonymous with self-management, as advertising models.. All young geniuses ㅇㅇ? ㅇㅇㅇ Originally, I only went to ‘Olive Young’, but from now on.. I will always go to Olive Young. Ah~~ It shines in advertisements Who came up with such an idea? Advertisement planning marketers deserve an award, seriously
Olive young! Let’s go Olive Young a lot, I love you Olive Young ♡ Since Taeyeon and Key are advertising, Olive Young takes care of a lot of things you need in daily life.. They help you.. It feels like you’ve played a big part in my life. Please continue to advertise in the future~~!
All young is life♡♡ Tanky is also life♡♡
All young, you work so well, go or turn on ♡
I love you King Kibum
The two of you filming an ad together, it's a lot of fun,,
Please always be together!!!!••
I love Olive Young too, but I think I go there more often because Ki-bum is my model ㅠ! Thank you Olive Young ㅠ! Love + love = happiness ㅠ
The real ad is always skipped when the skip 5 seconds pops up, but I can't skip this ad... Besides, I even look for Olive Young tanky commercials... I must have come to love the tanky combination so much... I should dedicate my wallet to Olive Young
A tanky combination you can trust and see Olive Young Go or go!
After seeing the ad, I ran into Olive Young without realizing it.
They both go so well together!
It's better to do it together :)
Can ads be this pretty??
Bonnie and Clyde as tangoo and keyer all-young advertisement, so it has a very refreshing feeling!!! All Young Advertising Model Contact Good
When it's hot in summer, the coolness you feel when you go all-young... Even the tanky poster... It's the best
Tanky Crazy All Young Ad Crazy Really the best .. I'm in tears ㅠㅠ
I didn't think that the first channel to leave a comment would be All Young, but Bonnie & Clyde is the truth!!! All-Young's sales are really good ㅠㅠ I promise to buy cosmetics from All-Young~
The chemistry between the two of them is perfect ️
Crazy tat TTTT kim kibeom ah TTTTTT you are so good TTTTTTTT
I was watching an ad on YouTube, so I tried to skip it, but when I saw the two of them came out ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's the first time I've watched all the ads till the end and even looked for them!! The chemistry is perfect..8o8)
Both are absolutely perfect~!!
Congratulations to all young models, let's only walk on flower paths from now on!!!^~^

I applaud Olive Young for recognizing Tanky.
That's why I couldn't not love Olive Young!?
They're both respectful, really ㅠㅠ I love you
I love you tanky .. ️ Who knew that the two people who were in charge of my elementary and middle school days would be responsible for my joy until they turned 27~~!!!
I didn't get anything fancy when I looked at any cosmetic advertisement, but I want to waste it right away as a pretty tanky who takes good care of it is advertised.
Key so cute
I'm sure he'll bring an advertising model with this combination ㅠㅠ He's really a genius Genius
Tango unnie why are you so pretty ㅠㅠ Every time I see her, her beauty is crazy ㅠㅠ Why is Kibeom's voice so sexy ㅜㅜ Crying cry ㅜㅜ
Tanky who believes and sees ㅠㅠ As expected, CJ Anmok Olive Young, a large corporation, I love you, I love Nolto
Tanky combo is the best!!! I really like the Olive Young commercials ㅠㅠ️
The advertisement itself seems to have come out neat and pretty.... ㅠㅠ I'm proud of my singers...
Taeyeon is awesome
If a tanky who is strict with self-management advertises like this, he has no choice but to turn on Olive Young,,,,,,
This week, Olive Young really went down for 4 days in a row... Spend about 10 million won..
I enjoyed the chemistry between the two of you in Nolto, but the chemistry in the advertisement is stinky haha
I saw the tank combination in Nolto and All Young. The best combination tanky.
The combination of Olive Young and Tanky siblings is so perfect!!!
I'm going to go buy another one!!!
Be with the Kim brother and sister for a long time Olive Young
I will take care of you too ️️
Tanky Bonnie & Clyde I can't stand the virtues Reliable Olive Young commercial models I'm running Olive Young Wait for me, please accept my love made with Nolto. Stay strong, you have to be happy in the future!!

Tanky Legend Guild I love you both All Young and Nolto
Thank you for casting Taeyeon as a model. Go Olive Young!
Olive Young, who I often go to, chose the model perfectly. Thanks to the model, I want to go once more and just did
I really love Tanky and Allyoung..
Olive Young♡ Every time I see an ad on TV, it makes me happy! I think people who are good at self-management are more reliable because they advertise!
Kim kibum best boy ♡︎
The strongest tank combination... Work less and earn more. Teachers Olyoung ㅜㅜ But… To be honest, please work hard and give me more tanks... hehe
The best advertising model Tanky for the best brand Olive Young
Thank you for taking responsibility for the best life
The concept is perfect, I love you so much I went in front of Olive Young yesterday and looked at pictures.
Oh my gosh, our height and taenggo are in Olive Young commercials.... The tanky combination is crazy ㅜㅜㅜㅜ It’s so good to be able to watch taenggo with height every time we go to Olive Young TTTT Now if you change all YouTube ads to Olive Young, even if they say ads appear once a minute, we don’t use premium. I will write...
First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Shawol who really love the chemistry between the two and Olive Young for making their wishes come true. I was originally an All-Young slave, but just take my bankbook ㅠㅠ Ten

I'm seriously promoting it to people around me too ㅠㅠ Tanky and All Young are great!! Olive young who does a good job is the best ️
oh so good I watch a 30-second ad for 30 hours
The brand image and model are perfect!!! Goes well with house-soon taengoo & universal housekeeper Ki's go or go~~
Crazy... It just shines in the advertisement.. Tanky combination is crazy. The concept is perfect Olive Young Take my bankbook..
Cherry Blossom Taengoo Really this is Liz... Depending on what kind of taenggoo expression, it changes from cherry blossoms to strawberries to grapefruit and then to a sudden change. Gibeomi also usually only hears her voice and then spreads it out, so it makes my heart flutter... It's been 15 years and I'm currently living looking only at tanks.
The two of my favorite Yeonyan were happy to play together, but now they even advertise together! I've been using Olive Young often, but I'm going to use it even harder!!
I think the tanky combination really suits Olive Young. Even people who know Olive Young will hear it at least once. That's me.
SHINee KEY
I turned on Olive Young because of Keybeom, but Olive Young sells a lot and gives a lot of coupons.
TaengKey
Isn't it so much love for the tanky combination, Olive Young has a great eye!!
Because of the Tanky siblings, watching the All Young commercials is the start of the day Thank you for taking responsibility for starting my day Tanky All Young ♡
I really love you tanky... … ️️ It really suits you so well... … Pretty and handsome, I'll eat it all. Thank you Olive Young...
Tanky combination is love
All-Young quickly caught the tangi combination haha
The tteoksangazah~ The advertisement is very refreshing and refreshing haha
you are doing well
this is this
The Kim brothers and sisters who make me want to imitate everything they do and make them trust me are models, so how can I not love Olive Young!! Thanks to you, I became a sparrow...♡
Moya Moya Key and Taeyeon.. The cami is very good. I saw an advertisement on YouTube, so I looked it up. She is very pretty and handsome. Olive Young does a good job.
The tanky combination is really the best I think I go to Olive Young more often to listen to the songs of Tango and Key!! Continue the tanky combination in the future ️
This combination really deserves an award.
Tanky--Bonnie & Clyde's chemistry rumors are going to come all the way here Ha, of course, Olive Young... You have a very good eye for people... If that's the case, I can't stop going!! I'm really going!!
Kibummie
Originally, I was a Bon2B skincare fanatic Olive Young sparrow, but my K-pop favorites are Olive Young models??? I can't stand this! I'll give you some money Olive Young
Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-bum... My heart thief...
How did you come up with such a perfect match...?
Really, I'm serious with Olive Young now

These advertisements appear frequently on TV these days, but every time I see them, I feel proud and upset... hehe
Thanks to you, I also went to Olive Young after a long time!!!!
A tanky that makes me find advertisements myself♡ Advertisers have achieved their goals
Bonnie and Clyde's main job..☆ Olive Young, I commend you for using these two as models... I just love you. No, a lot!! How do you know that Olive Young is a big part of my daily life~~ Olive Young is a great~~~

Tanky♡ It really goes well with Olyoung♡
Ah, Tanky, why are you so good at advertising..!!
Thanks to Bami, we turn on Olive Young
I go to Olive Young thanks to taengoo
K-pop legends Kim brother and sister, Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde Taeyeon and Key, are you shooting legends in advertisements?? The combination of self-care queen and king is perfect. I support the tanky combination!! I love you all-young~ Be with Tanky for the rest of your life~
Olive Young seems to do a really good job with her models... I love you... Work hard and earn a lot...
It's an advertisement for Taengoo and Key ㅠㅠ I didn't know they were going to be filming together, but I love Olive Young ️
Bonnie & Clyde Tanky Fighting If the unit that boasts the best beauty advertises Olive Young, it is right to buy it with confidence.
Olive Young, you do a great job.... It's the best, it's the best
What's going on with the tanky combination.. Thanks to Nolto, I'm so happy that I can see this combination often ㅠㅠ
A real tanky brother and sister, I really appreciate Olive Young for choosing my world's best brother and sister as her models!!!! ️️️️️️️
Tanky brother and sister forever. If you're tanky, you're Olive Young. If you're Olive Young, you're Tanky.
Watching All Young's video 1 a day is my routine
Grab my balance and give it to Olyoung
I have a lot of interest in beauty and believe in Tanky, the ultimate self-management king, let's go to K-beauty!!!
And I'm going to buy bagel chips today too~~
Tanky combination is the best! Olive young is the best!
No really ㅠㅠ The advertisement model is so perfect...
I go to Olive Young very often, but I think Tanky (or Bonnie and Clyde) will become a model so I will go there more often. Keuk The models are so pretty and fit well,,,♡ Do you believe the story that Olive Young often goes because of the models? First of all, I think I'll believe it. All-young is the best, tanky is the best.
Tanky Masita...!!!! Whether I go to Olive Young or turn on Olive Young, I go to Olive Young ️️ Every time I go, I have a tanky face, so it’s great
They are both pretty and handsome :) I love you Tanky
As if I'm going all-young right away, it's so perfect right? Looks like I'll have to keep doing it for a few years... What should I do with my wallet...
Tanky Siblings ㅠㅠ It's a trustworthy combination ㅠㅠ One more excuse to go all-young ㅠㅠ
From tanky Nolto fixed to all-young model ㅠㅠ CJ is the best ♡.♡
How is it that the commercial model is also a tanky... It's so good. Thanks to Tanky, I have more things to do or go to Olive Young!! All Young Fighting! Key fighting! Taeyeon fighting! ️️
I'm crazy because it's so cute
Haha.. My favorite combination.. Tanky ㅠㅠ Heuk, heuk, heuk, but those two are Olive Young models? Haha I can't take my eyes off Olive Young, a combination that can only make my wallet open... ㅠㅠ
Tanky x Olive Young, how can you not love me?
Ah, I really like this combination. If the tanky siblings buy it, I'll buy it. Reliability
ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ The best national siblings in 2020 following Yoo Jae-seok and Hyori.... Thanks to Tangu Onni, my bank account will be empty faster...^^ Still, I'm ♡happy♡
The two of them have great chemistry in Nolto, but their chemistry is great even in advertisements. As expected, the two of them get along well wherever they go!!
Reminds me of Kibeom who used chop chops on his face in Mt. Nahon.
The combination of Tank X Key Olive Young is absolutely good. I think I need to turn on Olive Young or go right now.
Every time this ad appears on TV, I am moved..... All-Young X Taengoo X Ki-Bum... I really love All Young
It's a combination of cj's son Key and cj's daughter Taeyeon!!! It's my favorite combination in Nolto and I'm so so so happy to see it in the Olive Young commercial ️ Olive Young and the concept are perfect, I just want to thank you!!!!! Bonnie & Clyde of Nolto Thank you to Olive Young and Nolto as well. It's still booming, but let's get more excited!!!!!!!
Our Kibum is the best ️Taenggoo is pretty
Kim brother and sister's cami is so good!!!!! I love Olyoung, who knew that too!!!!
Tanky is so perfect, and I feel so good because of Tanky, who welcomes me every time I go to All Young.
Thanks to the two models who are good at self-management, I have a desire to manage myself,,,,,
I love the chemistry of the two of you ㅠㅠ

Kim Ki-beom is crazy ㅠㅠ This is a great choice for All Young ㅠㅠ I will give all of my salary to All Young ㅠㅠ Let’s be together for a long time, Kim Ki, All Young
Where is the planner who thought of using the tanky combination as a model?
I will give a big shout out to that thank you so much ㅠㅠ
How is this an advertisement? It's eye cleansing and facial muscle stress ㅠㅠ My clown, who doesn't go up because he's only studying, is crazy about the visuals throughout the commercial, so the clown doesn't come down..
Originally, my wallet was stolen from Olive Young, so take them all ㅠㅠ!
I saw a tanky ad in All Young and liked it so much, let's leave the room!
The tanky combination is a real legend.. All-Young is doing a good job, I'll visit often.
I can't watch this ad even if I skip all the ads. If pretty people do that, I can't help but watch it... Her skin is beautiful.
Tanky combination perfect rice cake,, ️️
️Turn on the Olive Young app once a day
It's all-young's advertising model casting and planning.
Olive Young officials, please give me some details on tanky pocadas or postcards?!?!?!????!!!?!? As a fan, I can't tolerate the fact that the advertisement was taken so beautifully and there are no goods... Huh...
Olive Young's model is chosen very well Testimonial~~

It's so refreshing I can't take my eyes off of it!!

Testimonials of perfect rice cakes... Selection of what to do When water comes in, rowing 1st place in the water The two of the best self-management of all young match very well with the advertising concept.
When I go to work, I pass by all the time, and whenever I see Bonnie & Clyde on the glass door, I feel happy Juger.
All-young models are perfect, both ️️️
Hahahahaha I'm so happy from the thumbnail hahahahahahahaha I really like the tanky combination in SM the best....hehehehe
Tanky concept is perfect!! I've never seen a model that fits so well!! It's an All Young mill, so I've always heard of it, but I'll have to use it more often in the future!! Please do an event with a tank~ Take away my bankbook all year round~
I've been to Olive Young a lot, but I used Dream for the first time today. It's so comfortable! Olive Young and Olive Young’s talking tanky voice is so ᰔᩚ

What is the chemistry between the two of you? This ad is so addictive
She's so pretty, Tanky ㅠㅠㅠㅠ The concept fits so well.. It's an advertisement for a man who manages well, Kim Ki-beom.
tall taeyeon is so pretty
I'm envious that the reason I have good skin is because of Olyoung.
I really like the height, but it's just too good..
I'm watching Nolto, but the All Young ad came out and I can't skip it ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ Really ㅠ ㅠ I love you Tanky
Absolutely in favor of tanky combination
All-young and Tanky are still good, so I decided to go all-young.. Tanky and All-young, who are neat, bright and healthy images, are love ️

You must be really clever.... Tanky Kitang. How did you come up with such a combination?
tanky... I love you… … Healthy… … .
You are the one who digests even the pink hair and shit hair with respect...
Tanky is floating on Olive Young!! I'll have to go rob the olive young again this weekend.
Tanky + Olive Young = Truth♡
Bonnie and Clyde in All Young, whom I really love and use, and 'Tanky', full of chemistry between the fat brothers and sisters, are the models!!! No, you can’t go all year round˙ỏ˙ Just like a sparrow on the way home from going out, you can stop by and shop like a sparrow, and on your days off at home, you can turn on the app without having to go outside, so it’s perfect for housemates like me!!! Tell me what you are doing, you are the best♡ The one you used as a tanky model for All Youngs is an excellent choice! Because I'll be using it more often.
it's really good
If you see an advertisement like this, I'll run to Olive Young. Tanky.. I'll use Olive Young, who does a good job..
Kim brother and sister are the best, both are so pretty and handsome
Every time I pass by Olive Young, I look at the pictures and it heals!!
Aww, you'll be an all-young model for the rest of your life...
0:22 Sister… Are you a real fairy... Back to my sister's world... no don't go... never…

Tanky is so pretty... ️
I really love Olyoung. It’s Tanky. It’s Olyoung. It’s Tanky. I will go out and do it right tomorrow. I will come home and turn on Olyoung. Go or turn it on or both! Of course, my bank account will be empty! For Tanky and for All Young, I don't care if my bankbook becomes empty
The tanky siblings are so cute ㅠㅠ
You can't go to Olive Young, can you? Go on, turn on, or join!
Bonnie & Clyde Tanky in the best program of this era advertises, and even though they both bought with Kim Ki-beom as the ultimate self-manager, none of the products failed. This is something I can't help but believe in and buy, thank the advertiser for using me as a tanky ad model
SM’s Kim brother and sister, Olyoung, are perfect together.
I love Bonnie & Clyde's chemistry... .It's good to make a comeback ️‍️‍
All-young was all-young Tanky was tanky
Model perfect~~Kong-tteok hehe Human all-young itself hehe I love you Tanky I love you Olive Young
It really heals me every time I see it on TV.
Tanky Bonnie & Clyde's chemistry is so good. Make a model often, Jo!
He's really good with Kim Ki-bum.
The closest Olyoung~ Olyoung leaving alone! It's okay to buy as you please! He's the perfect commercial model, so just hearing Taeyeon's song reminds me of Olyoung hehe Kibeom, who has the best skin care routine more than anyone else, what can I say, I'm going to go on vacation this summer with Olyoung to become a person who radiates energy inside and out like Tanky,,
Ah, unnie, she's so pretty.... If you want to be a tanky Minsu Son, you have to go to Olive Young from now on. I just bought cosmetics, but now I have to give it meaning and buy cosmetics for Minsu Son~!! I have to
The origins of K-pop!!! The fact that Bonnie and Clyde's steamed cami, shown in SHINee and Girls' Generation's Nolto, is returning to a crisp concept in Olive Young, I think it's believable because these are products advertised by the kings of management.
tanky tanky
It's nice to be able to see you every day thanks to All Young these days
I saw it on TV and I saw it on All Young
Long live All Young!
Icon of self-management All the way through my elementary, middle and high school students, my brother was so pretty...
Nolto's (idol) Dandong former Bonnie Anne Clyde (aka. Tanky siblings) appeared as Olive Young's model, so there's nothing pretty in the world!! A place where you can go to the hospital and go to Olive Young, where you can see tanky with your eyes, listen to Soshi & SHINee songs with your ears, buy snacks to eat with your mouth, and shop in the wind of the air conditioner!! Olive Young is heaven!! ㅜㅜ Please model for a long time~~~~ Please
..Olive Young It was a sparrow that ate a surprise that just couldn't pass.
If you shake my heart with this tanky two visual, my heart will automatically go to you guys and my legs will automatically go to Olive Young or my hands will turn on!! I think I can easily feed you one meal..!!
All-Young, who knows a little bit well, has no choice but to do VERYNICE All-Young All-Young. Even if you don’t say anything, if you need something, you must first find All-Young. This week ️Gogo
All-Young Model's Choice is awesome... I love you forever tangouki~~~~~~~
Key Feat Taeyeon - Hate that, is out August 30th!Don’t forget to support our Kim Sibling!
I don't usually watch ads, but I come to watch it regularly. I saw this and installed the Olive Young app. Tanky suits you really well.
My routine is Taeyeon unnie, Beom, Taeyeon unnie, and Beom watching ♡ If you follow Nolto Duo Bonnie & Clyde, that is my life =)
Tanky Guild is really a good thing?? It goes really well with Olive Young, and I feel like the image of Olive Young, which I usually use well, has gotten better Yeyoung!!! I really like my idol's advertisement I love you Kim Ki-beom
Wool tanky ㅠㅠㅠㅠ He's a perfect model..... I've decided not to skip tanky commercials in the future. I'm going to install the All Young app.
Isn't it so perfect ㅠㅠ Where is CJ's headquarters? I will do it 108 times ㅠㅠ
Both of them are perfect models ㅠㅠ I love you Kim brother and sister
Bonnie and Clyde, the best model of this era, I love Tanky. It was a dream for the two of us to become models together, but it's the millionth thank you to Olyoung who made the dream come true ㅠㅅㅠ
If you are a fan of steamed essence, go to Olive Young! turn it on! Because tanky is a rip off

I'm so happy••• Olive Young, who decided to use the Kim siblings as models••• Very smart•••
All-young's eyes are very perfect Model Tanky combination is perfect, even the concept is perfect I love Allyoung I love Tanky
Who else could have such a perfect model other than Tanky?
Tanky is love ️‍️‍️‍ This combination is the best of All Young’s Sunguan!
The two are the same in Nolto. They look like fat siblings. Tanky is love.
I respect the advertiser's perspective I love you Olive Young
Olive young, well, good, well, white tanky
Tanky is the best
Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom are chosen as the model, so I think it suits them very well! I have to go all year round!!
Bonnie & Clyde Becomes All-Young Advertising Model
Yesterday too, I spent money on the Olive Young online mall.. Since I became a tanky model, these days since I was born, I seem to buy the most all young... Tanky is me.
I want to be pretty like Beom after shopping at All Young too ㅠㅠ!!!
A tanky combination I believe in..
Kim brother and sister, it's just love ㅠㅅㅠ Super pretty people advertise in cool places, so it's been 3 days since my cosmetics started to break, break and disappear one by one..I'm going to rob them soon
Pretty and handsome people stand side by side to shoot an advertisement, so they look brighter
I skip the ad and don't even look at it.
It's the first time I've been looking for it.
I usually go all-young often, but because of Bonnie & Clyde, I think I’m going to wear it all the more!
Please love Nolto, All Young, Bonnie & Clyde as well.
best tank combination
I will only use All Young for the rest of my life.
Bonnie and Clyde of Nolto
Vermi and Tango are both so cute, pretty and cool!!
Olive young is the best
You're really a genius, chosen as my tanky combination model that I really love. Tanky Forever
I always passed by Olive Young in front of me... .makes me go.
It really goes well with Tanky Allyoung. Wow.... She's so pretty and cool, but Tanky who takes good care of her is great.
Olive young, take all my money, tanky is the best
Bonnie and Clyd finally did a CF shoot... .
As a Bonnie and Clyde Debut Fan
tears cover my face
Is there really no one who doesn't know Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-bum's union?? ㅠㅠ No, Kim sibling's beauty, what's going on.. Thank you for being a real advertiser as a tanky model. Work less and earn a lot. I'll have to visit a lot in the future
Taeyeon and key
Everything is perfect from the fact that All-Young was modeled after the tanky ㅠㅠ I'm turning on All-Young right now.
Olive young... I love you... Wool tanky, we'll be together forever...
so perfect
Originally, I liked Olive Young, but I like it even more after Kioppa became a model ㅠㅠ I really like the tanky sibling chemistry at Nolto, but Olive Young is also filming an advertisement because of Kioppa, I think I'll be tired of Olive Young.
The tanky siblings look so good together~
Tanky very fresh and positive energy, please do aggressive marketing as an all-young tanky
I love you sister and brother
The best of Nolto Bonien Cloud....
Taengo Zero Key Comme des Garçons ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ Everyone should be happy
Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde finally made it to commercials ㅠㅠ Support the chemistry between the two
It's really lovely ㅠㅠ
I'm a fan of Nolto, so I want to use it as a tanky model for Olive Young.
Wow, this is really the best cutie cute sexy one in this era. How did you think of making a good choice for the world's wildest and stylish people as an advertising model? Look at those beauties that break through the screen in the world, I'm on YouTube When you see this advertisement, it's just dazzling, so it's your job to take care of your sunglasses. Tanky, please continue to work hard both in Nolto and outside with this chemistry..><♡
How did you think of casting Taeyeon unnie and Kibeom oppa... ㅠㅠ They both look so good together
It's crazy, these two are advertisements lol
Nolto All Young, everyone is happy!!!!
I applaud All Young for making a cool advertisement with Tanky God Guild as a model.
Tanky Siblings, congratulations on becoming all-young models
There was a tanky poster in All Young Window, so I went in and applied for a product accident event ️️٩(๑′∀ ‵๑)۶•*¨*•.¸¸♪
Using Koduk Taeyeon and the height of the final boss of self-management as models, I was determined to sweep Olive Young's money; Is there any model more reliable than this? I was still thinking about buying Shadow, but after seeing the ad, I decided to go to Olive Young tomorrow.
Olive young.... I'm a tanky after I left my job.
If I had known it would be like this, I would have stretched out 10 years more ㅠㅠ
Key is so handsome
Tanky's face is tvn...because there's no end to the fun... It's not fun, it's lovely. It's the first time I've seen an ad that's so perfect. Please shoot an ad for the rest of my life ㅜㅜ It's because people who are more strict than anyone else in self-management did it, so I guess they felt the sincerity in the ad... What the hell can't the two of you do? Don't make my heart flutter.
If you are in a hurry to buy something in a hurry, or go shopping on the way to All-Young, just like an advertisement, so it seems that there are some things that resonate with you more because you are tanky, so I want to go more.
Tanky Kim brother and sister commercials are the best... Olive Young, let's be together...
They're like legendary SM siblings, they're both so pretty
All-Young is Life As if this copy is steamed up, I can't imagine a life without All-Young...
You said tanky, I heard the news and bought it after putting up with buying daily necessities until 8/2, when the tanky model starts!!! Long live Olive Young~~~~!!!!!
Thanks to the perfect brother and sister tanky
I used to just go to Olive Young, but now I’m even turning it on.
I love you CJ>_<
All Young Tanky, be together for the rest of your life
Olive Young, who first caught this combination as a model... You are the Winners... It's perfect...
Is this the true story of the tanky combination? I'm now robbed of my bankbook at Olive Young. Esp my bankbook balance is halfway through~ You've known tanky chemistry since I came out as a Nolto guest as a tangoo... From the beginning of my debut, I found out about the tanky combination while watching SM entertainment and interview Mcar. Don't you know.... Tanky brother and sister union is the best, but why people didn't know about it, but when he finally recognizes it, Rylfrik sheds tears. CJ's son Kibeom takes care of CJ's daughter Taengoo. Please make a lot of pretty advertisements in the future and make lots of Olive Young goods and events
My favorite tanky is the model....that's also Olive Young This grandmother is crying and crying ㅠㅠ I love you all young!
Tanky is so cute oh oh oh

I love you so much Kim Ki-bum!!!!!! Because of you, I bought all the cosmetics I don't need right now! Thank you for making Olive Young Kibum as an advertising model ️ Taengoo and Kibum go perfectly with Olive Young! Rice cake! Izana~~~
It's good for the two of them to appear in Nolto, but it's even better because they also advertise together.
I didn't know that I would look for advertisements in my life and wait for them to come out.. I love tanky..
Tanky can be this perfect
You two are so perfect....
Tanky is so pretty ㅠㅠ I've been going more often after becoming a commercial model ㅠㅠ

Ads are so fresh. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, CJ, I love you ️️
They are all-young advertising models for the tanky siblings who have great management skills. This is really perfect, but the advertising concept is also very clever.
Tank combo? I can't stand this, I'm going to get some Olive Young's money.
We love our tanky brothers and sisters...️ I love you, praise Olive Young, who was used as a model for the tanky brothers and sisters!! so pretty... good hehehehe

Tanky is love! My routine is also Olive Young!
I have a reason to visit Olive Young more often hahahaha
Tanky Guild = Just love.. I don't usually wear makeup, but Tanky is my advertising model???? Yes, then, if you use the things you bought at Olive Young well, you can learn makeup after turning Olive Young first with the mindset that you will become like a tanky. I will dedicate my bankbook to Olive Young. tanky chan
They even filmed commercials with Bonnie & Clyde in Nolto~~ In the meantime, it’s tango Johnyeㅠ

It really makes me want to go and turn it on so much that I want to follow my own routine!! The concept and models are perfect haha
Olive Young (offline store) and Olive Young (online store). This is a good idea.. Wow, Tanky is so cute hehe
No, thanks to the Olive Young Tanky ad, the desire to purchase has increased by 923% haha ​​I haven't used all of my foam cleanser and skin care products yet, but is it a true story? However, this is an unfinished journey. As long as Olyoung and Tanky are together, Olyoung is responsible for my daily routine. Take My Money and Keep Going Tanky
I moved... to Olive Young
How can you not love the tank team?? I really love you so much... I went to Olive Young today...^^ Olive Young's best Olive Young's open wallet for the rest of my life... Thank you~^^
The tanky model is the perfect testimonial!! There seems to be no more all-young models!!!

Tanky Combination Malmo Malmo . . Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon in All Young It’s over, it’s over, Olive Young is the best.ᐟ.ᐟ.ᐟ.ᐟ ️️️
But what's really strange is that Key and Taeyeon both feel a bit alike, don't they? There is something like this, but there is something like that, both of them place importance on skin care and self-care, and there are things that the two have in common, but those two!!! This Olive Young advertisement? It's just a perfect model...
Bonnie & Clyde is the best I went all-young a while ago, but it was nice to hear the voices of the two of you continuously coming out~
I really like Taeyeon’s key combination, I also like Olive Young
Even if I was craving for drinks, I was more serious about Olive Young than Ki-beom Kim, who lives in Olyoung. Now, I don't buy masks online in bulk anymore, I buy them at All Young according to my mood.
It's perfect!! I love you
There's an all-young under the academy, and every time I see the poster, Bonnie and Clyde say hello to my friends and say they're crazy ㅋㅋ The two of them chemistry Mersun 129 They really robbed my bankbook.
Tanky is love
How can you not love the Tanky Guild!!!!!
I'm running right away....
Live and live, come to look for advertisements...
The credibility of Olive Young in me is rapidly increasing.
Olive young has become an essential course on the way home from work after Ki-beom became a model.
Thank you all young, thank you oppa, thank you, Taeyeon, thank you, thank you, tanky, my life is just tanky :)
Thanks to the image of the two of the trustworthy tankies, the credibility of All Young is also increasing...

Heuk-heuk All-young I was still refraining from purchasing, but is this happening? I will come to be a pair of all-young, I love you Tanky
Is it a true story that Tanky is an All Young commercial? I'm stuck on both sides of the visual. I'm using both eyes separately because I'm concentrating on one side.
It's great to be filming an Olive Young commercial with the beloved tanky Kim brother-in-law~~ ️‍
I'm a person who usually refreshes even when there are a few ads, but I can't get past All Young's ads...

How can even an advertisement be so refreshing? Allyoung goes to vip
It goes so well with the pink color ♧♧

An ad that makes you feel good every time you see it!
Tanky is the best, I love you

The two of us who have similar pictograms are so pretty because they were filmed together like this ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I like you--..Allyoung communicates a lot through Twitter ㅠㅠ
The key was master key, and Taeyeon was just acting casually.
The union is really crazy. Thank you, advertiser...
Taeyeon OLIVE YOUNG Zzang
A poster attached to Olive Young every time I pass by.

I am so proud of seeing it (why am I? hehe).. Every time an All-Young advertisement comes up, I don’t skip it and watch it to the end.. I am sincere in All-Young… … Take all my money away by all means
Olive Young, who hired the best model Tanky, can't be a genius.... ️️️ Originally, I used to go there often, but now I'm going to take attendance stamps every day ㅠㅠㅠㅠ All-Young-chan, Taeyeon, Key Fighting ️️️️
My only cosmetics store is Olive Young. I will buy snacks at All Young and cosmetics only at All Young ㅠㅠ

I love you, Tanky Olive Young ️
Both of them are thorough in self-management, have good chemistry, are pretty, and have good visuals, how is this combination...
The Kim brothers and sisters who are good at taking care of themselves make me want to go to All Young even more because they advertise. I'm following along haha ​​Olive Young & Tanky-chan!
Advertisement model jiiyinja well chosen
At home, I was watching TV and watching Tanky, I was so surprised !!!! The chemistry between the two of them is so good, it's just a perfect combination...!!!!
Bonnie & Clyde Taeyeon, Key
It's really nice to see it in your favorite tanky combination ad! I really appreciate Olive Young's tanky model~ I usually skip ads to watch, but when a tanky ad comes out, I think I'll watch it to the end!
Tanky combination is the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Really, I think the best choice for All Young 2021 is the Tanky model. There is no other model that suits All Young as much as Tanky ~~~~! !! ! ! !
I go to Olive Young more often than I do at home... because of the appearance of Tanky. it's gonna be fun Home, etc.
Thank you for filming the ad with the tanky combination. I'm so, so, so, so happy!! Still, I go to Olive Young often, but I want to go more often!!! Don't skip the YouTube ad, make sure to watch it, and when you see a tanky while flipping channels, stop and watch it!! Thank you so much, Olive Young is the best, Tanky is the best
Olive Young believes and lives! I will continue to live only with Olive Young! It's so good, the person who advertises it is tanguraki ㅜㅜ
The best tanky and olive young go well together, right? It's not easy to get an eye on the advertisements that appear on YouTube or TV, but the magic that makes me not want to skip it, and the magic that makes me fall in love with the Olive Young stores that I pass by without thinking! I hope Tanggi and Olive Young go on for a long time with good content and advertisements. <3
Once as soon as it was released, twice whenever I think of it, three times as a TV commercial Best ad Olive Young's best combination tanky!! It goes perfectly with olive young!
Every time I see an advertisement, my desire to go to All Young increases by 923%!
I will go more often
Key and Taeyeon, hey hey hey hey hey
I'm surprised to see it on TV, I'm surprised to see it again
The concept fits perfectly with the tanky combination, and I can't help but love it.
My little one is the best.... I skipped the original advertisement knife, but I watched all the young ones until the end of Indomitable ㅠ
It's an Olive Young commercial with Kibeom and Taengoo.
Kim brother and sister, I will also take care of the routine with Olive Young.
The concept is so perfect Kim brother and sister... The casting is more perfect because they are together, really ㅜㅜ
I can't stand it if it's a tank combination hahaha
Because Tanky is a model, I really want to buy it ㅠㅠ It was Sparrow 1 that I couldn't pass up by all means, but I'm so happy to have fellow sparrows.
I can't go these days, so I'll have to turn it on.. lol
Tanky Olive Young combination.. I can't go wrong with it ㅠㅠ!!!
Our Kibum is so pretty ㅠㅠ He's so pretty ㅠㅠ Tango is cool and suits him very well.. Bonnie Anne Cloudy (or tanky) is a human Olive Young ㅠ
Tanky is the best Korea's best chemistry Siblings Kim Sis Do whatever you want, I love you
Both of the tanky siblings are so cute and pretty. I will use them more often in the future.
It's Olive Young and Tanky's meeting, what more do I need to say?
Ha, I really like this combination.. All the young people I know, I praise you, I really like it, it’s the best..
When I watch Nolto's broadcast, the All-Young commercial comes up, but I can't get over it ㅠㅠ Now it's almost automatic reflection day and night!!! Inside and outside!!! Inside and outside!!! And if taengoo does every routine in the world, Olive Young!!! That's why people around me see so many ads that they say that I memorize all the commercials.. Haha. When I see all the ads on TV, I stare at them like a meerkat, and in the end, thank you.
The two of them finally did an advertisement!! I've been waiting for this moment!!
I knew they were fat brothers!! Why do you look so good together? It's funny
Such a perfect combination... ♡ I usually go all-young, but I go more often when I’m in tanky.. I love you all-young..
I went all-young to see the tanky I saw in Nolto and bought a shampoo and came in... heh I have to participate in the event.
...I'll install the app...
The Kim siblings who are good at taking care of themselves will go to Olive Young more like a mill thanks to her accompanying CF. Please advertise for a long time
All the routines in the world ㅠㅠ This ad is perfect for Tanky
Tanky is advertising, how can he keep All Young off..
I'm going right away to get the perfect combination Olive Young.
Nolto hahahaha I uploaded this as a recommended video hahaha Nolto is the best
Oh, what are you doing with the tank combination? ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Aren’t you the king of self-management?
It's not the olive young x tanky combination... It's perfect...
I went all-young and got a poster too, it's so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Olive young is the best
Go or turn it on ㅜㅜ Advertise it so that All-Young becomes a lifestyle.. The model is also a very good chemistry model, this advertisement ㅜㅜ I really like it
I've brought in the best advertising models. All the best.
Tanky is so cute ㅠㅠㅠㅠ The Kim siblings are the best
All Young and Nolto are both in love ㅠㅠ Because of Tanky, I’m happier if I go to All Young ㅠㅠ Everywhere I look, there’s Tanky ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Occupying the Nolto snack game and even taking over the Olive Young commercial... I envy Olive Young because these pretty Tango and handsome Kibum are the commercial models... I'm envious...
All-Young's excellent eye for choosing a tank is incredible!! The commercials are great too haha ​​The credibility of what Tanky is talking about bb
I love it ♡
Tanky union is the best ㅜㅜ People who take good care of it are models ㅜㅜ
Olive young.. I am happy to see Tanky every time I pass by.. Happy Sams.
All-young models who are good at self-management. . . .It's a cracker. . . . .
It's a tanky combination with Olive Young, which I used to love.
I'll solve all the routines in the world at Olive Young ^^7 Let's put this and that and let it go
Tanky Siblings is the best Thank you for filming an ad with this combination ㅠㅅㅠ Allyoung and Tanky Forever
It's the first time I've seen an advertisement this hard... It's so pretty ㅠㅠ
The person in charge who cast the tank, where are you, please take me
Celebrities who are really good at managing them come out and advertise, so just going to Olive Young gives me the feeling of being managed hahaha
No hahahaha Why is this on the Nolto channel recommendation video hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
To hear that All Young's models, who make us King God General Ultra-beautiful, become tanky siblings ㅜㅜㅜㅜ All youngs, how high are your eyes? This is why my bankbook doesn't sit still ㅜㅜ Even if it's empty, I'm happy to see all-young models calling me
The best of all time ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ What's wrong with her beauty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ The Tanky Siblings ️ Let's take over the advertising industry!!!!!
tanky is love
Tanky & Bonnie & Clyde I totally agree with this combination!! Thank you all ><
It's pretty, it suits you perfectly
Tanky combination is always in favor ️️
It's a meeting between K-pop legend Girls' Generation and SHINee... It was the same with Nolto, but I'm really proud instead of it, and my heart is enlarged...
They both take good care of them, so they really suit Olive Young...!! The real Taeyeon Kim and Kibum Kim. Two perfect people and perfect olive young haha ​​Take all my money... Yes, my wallet is important!!!
Nolto completed the event more than anyone else in Bonnie & Clyde!!
It goes so well with Olive Young ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ If Tanky recommends it, I think I'll just buy it because it's fluttering.
Who decided the advertising model? It's a hit 77ㅑ
Visual craftsmen Honey skin, healthy, even a spoonful is perfect for all young
Oh really go crazy ㅠㅠ I love you and my brother Kim and I will protect you for the rest of my life ㅠㅠ Only use all the young people ㅠㅠ
The two of you are so perfect Arningyo?!???? All Young..!
Tanky Guild I agree with you♡
Fighting anytime, anywhere!
my singers
It's late now, so I'll turn it on and go tomorrow~
Really... Olive Young with two prettiest people in the world is the best... If our pretties are doing Hungbo, Absolutely have fun!!
No, the real tanky must go together forever!!! SM fanatics will bury their bones here.
Kim brother and sister will advertise together....
.....♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
You should watch this ad on TV
I miss TaeKey!
I love that it's Olive Young with this combination that's perfect with Tanky.
The best entertainer of this era..cj.....
It's not an advertisement for the Kim Siblings.
Let's only walk on the advertising road
Bring my bankbook
Tanky is the best ️
they both fit so well
Olive Young, the two that are most likely to be used (Bonnie and Clyde)
what. what. E.Group E.G. Yu. Myung Hy. Nol. To. N. T. Bon. Ni. N. Cl. La. E. De. In Ga.!.!.?
From the beginning, I was impressed with the face and hit the bottom of my head, and now I am in Argentina^^
As an adult, there are so many really good products in All Young, so I thought you only looked at products.
Can you see the angle of the finger and arm that takes care of that nutritional supplement of Tango, and those 3rd and 4th fingers that rotate when Beom is doing skin care? Ah, this is the nature of the people who manage it!!! It's not like they're not people who usually don't~~~ They're the two of us who would have digested perfectly no matter what time they called me~~ (Jing-Chang-Jang-Goo-Kung-Dong-Dong-Dong-Dong) I went to Olive Young today, but I waited longer to see the pictures of the two of them.
The concept is perfect.. Every time an advertisement comes out, I go to Olive Young at home, turn it on, or follow it hahahaha
Tanky combination is crazy, just... All-Young is a store I go to often, but this combination is very strong. I will visit All-Young again. The people I like and the store I like are combined.. I just don't need words ㅠㅠ All-Young does a great job!!
genius ol young
I love olive young! The artist you like is the advertising model ㅠㅠ The happiness is double. I love you Tanky.
Huh, that's cool....
Kim brother and sister Olive Young advertisement

!!!! Still, I often go to Olive Young, but I’m so glad that I became people who even like advertising models.
Big tanky is perfect!!! The two of us are tired of the routine and not doing it!!!
Turn on the housekeeper~ All-Young*Tanky
Tanky is the best. There is no other perfect combination like this. I love you, Olive Young, I love you, Tanky.
Tanky. ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Olive Young protects the inside and outside, and Tango and Kibalm that protects even my heart♡♡♡
I only go to Olive Young, but the tanky Kim brothers and sisters advertise together so I go there more often!!! my routine keepers
Taeyeon's height was good when I saw the combination of Nolto, but it's an Olive Young commercial!!!! Tango as a keyer hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
The chemistry between Kibum and Tango is really pretty. Ki-bum became a model, so I have to work hard to buy it. Kibum, fighting Mechida Kibum!!!!!
I go a lot all year, but I will go even more Tanky♡♡♡♡
The tanky combination is the best,,, charming Taeyeon and tall Olive Young models ㅠㅠ Thank you Olive Young ️ Tanky Forever
Kill Kimki ㅠㅠㅠㅠ They look good together Olyoung and the tanky brother I love Mani..
I love Taeyeon's key!!!!@@!!!!!!!!!!!! Olive Young is so perfect.
Tanky is absolutely perfect!! It's so good to be with my beloved Olyoung
The combination is the best testimonial
Both of them are so cute ️️️
Praise the advertiser's eye for recruiting the Tanky Siblings... He's a complete human, Olyoung, I'm following every advertisement at his house.
All Young Poca is so pretty
I am so moved that I am in a generation that sees the K-Idol representatives, Kim brothers and sisters filming commercials together ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I love and thank Olive Young who understands all of our needs and works hard...️‍️‍️‍
And I love you, Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-beom and Kim Siblings ㅠㅠ️‍
Our tangoo and kiberme models are perfect~!!!! Thank you!!!!!!
Kim brother and sister are my favorite combinations, but they became the models I go to most often in Olive Young!!!! Now that I go to Olive Young, I think Tango and Kibum will see them, so I think I will go sooner and more often. I used to love Olive Young, but I will love you more.
The two have crazy faces ㅠㅠ They're not siblings..
️️ the best
They both look really pretty and handsome...I think I'm going crazy...
I really like Tango and Bumkey...
Kibum, you're handsome...
Kim and brother-in-law's chemistry is Meseon-il.. Both tankies go well with Olive Young.. Olive Young is the best ㅠㅠ
The casting of this model was very successful...... All-young, who goes every few months, now opens a store every week ㅜㅜ I'm obsessed with the tanky union ㅜㅜ
tanky best
It's a tanky combination.. I'm in favor of this combination♡
Wool Kibum is so handsome It goes perfectly with Olive Young, thanks to 'b' Vermi, I will become a regular Olive Young regular haha
All-Young with Tanky♡ Let’s be together with my wallet♡
The best combination I love the best advertisement of this era
Thank you for using me as a tanky ad model.
I love you, tanky, it goes so well with the olive young model, take all my money and love you ️️️
The image of Tanky X Olive Young is perfect ️
You can't see the ad made with the tanky combination. You can't go without Olive Young.
I saw this as an advertisement on TV, and the two of them look so good together..♡^o^♡
I think I did a good job shooting the advertisement hahaha
I love you, tanky, where in the world can you find such a perfect model~~!!
All-Young A place where everything I need is there ♡♡The Nolto sign advertises! I have a feeling it will be better ♡.♡
The tanky casting was truly a miracle.. After seeing it, I went to Olive Young and bought a toner... TTTT I'm going to wipe like Kim Ki-beom...
Everyone. Fairies exist...
Olive Young is the best.. You chose the advertising model very well.
The tanky combination is just light☆ All-young and tanky combination.. I'll go to the all-young soon!!
Aㅇㅇ...aㅇㅇ...that's cute...
Kim brother and sister.. I'm a regular in Olive Young commercials, so I'm going to die, now, let's go beyond drug stores and eat department stores and world-famous brands~!! Come on! ️
oh dazzling
Isn't Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom the perfect brother and sister combination? The screen that comes out when the two of them crosses is great, the voices are so good, and it's just perfect chemistry, so I watch the ad and don't skip it.
It's a tanky sibling union, so Olive Young is just god... The two advertised as gods of self-management, so they are more reliable and the concept is perfect ㅠㅠ Still, it's Olive Young, which is indispensable in real life, but now I'm happier every time I visit. feeling like it could be done
Tanky worked, worked
Ha, really Tanky x Allyoung is perfect ㅠㅠ The chemistry between the two of them goes so well together, and the two of them with perfect self-management are doing an All-Young advertisement together.
You look so good and you look so good
It's so pretty and so cool, I think I'll have to go shopping in All Young again
Tanky crazy combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Olive Young Thank you for bringing these two together ㅠㅠ Can an advertisement be this pretty?! It goes well with the brand image.. Thanks to you, I feel so good whenever an advertisement appears on TV!!! Taeyeon Kim is the best, Kibum Kim is the best!!!!
Tanky combination is crazy hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I love you Kim Tae-yeon I love you Kim Ki-bum
It's really at the level of Taeyeon and Kim Ki-beom's video pictorials ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm tired of faces, camera angles, and lighting TTTT All the Olive Young teams who planned this ad are a bonus GUZA!!!!!
Go or turn on ️️
I really go there almost every day.... ㅠㅠ I buy all the lotions, tints, and packs from All Young!!! But it's not a tanky combination, it's crazy ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'll go more often in the future
A chemistry that looks so good...a tanky combination that gives you a sense of stability just by looking at it!! I use it often, but I think I will use it more often.
If Tanky advertises, you should definitely buy it. Yeah, take my wallet.
The Olive Young model is called a tanky, so run away right away~ ㅠㅠ Thank you so much who the hell thought of casting a tanky like this for the king co-op.... As someone who usually wants to live life with a tanky routine, the concept of the advertisement is also very good. Even Hemeko, the fluorescent tone that goes well with the tanky, is so refreshing and nice. All I have to do is save money.
I can't even imagine a life without the two of you, but you're using a tanky card...? I can't stand tanky all young...
 Can ads be this fun? Why did I only see advertisements at night?
Totally in favor of this combination!!!! I love it so much ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Thank you for writing Beom and Tam
Really tanky is crazy TT In particular, he’s really good at taking care of his skin, so he’s perfect for All Young commercials ㅜㅜ I can’t lose this combination.. I think Tango is aging backwards… Let’s shoot a lot of other commercials for Tanky ㅜㅜ
so pretty
Wow, Tanky is an All-Young model, so crazy and crazy ㅠㅠ I used to use All-Young often, but thanks to Tanky, I plan to go more often. Thank you, advertisers, for using Tanky.
Self-management The perfect tanky is an All-Young ad. It's better than any other advertising model
I like it because it is an advertisement full of healthy beauty. I applaud the excellent choice because the top-tier tanky in the entertainment industry is a model. I lost money and went to get my skin back.. Olive young #Let's go #You can turn it on
What a fantastic combination this is!!!!
Kim Tae-ki, the one I love the most ㅠㅠ️
I love you tanky sister
Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom's combination is great.
But maybe it's just me, this ad has never appeared, and it's 10 to 15 seconds long from another previous story, but only Taeyeon came out all the time, but now, since that incident, only height comes out. what..?
All-Young Master is possible with Tanky! The best All-Young and the best idol, Tanky, you're the best... From here to there, give me everything Kim Ki-bum writes 'w'
If it's a tanky combination, I'll definitely buy it!!! Please give me tanky poker and face-studded goods! I run~
CJ's son Kim Ki-beom ㅜㅜ
The tanky combination is perfect ㅠㅠ I'm going to get rid of Olive Young...
Tanky All Young Forever,
Look at how the tanky Allyoung looks so perfect... Not to mention their looks, they both have such pretty voices, so I have to run to Olive Young right now, what should I do? Olyoung's eyes are insane
I love you tanky brother and sister chemistry
Did you know that this ad appears in the recommended video at the end of the Nolto video? I came to see the ad because I was surprised.
I am very satisfied with the keybeom and tango combination.
Saw this ad and saw Sooreum
Tank Combination
Oh, it's really good~!~!~ So cute!
I love tanky, Olive Young is the best...I thought of how to use tanky as a model ㅠㅠ A real genius, I work little and earn a lot All Young
Go to Olive Young or turn it on~
Tanky combination is the best All Young White Tank
I don't know the routine. Routine = Olive Young. Oh, when you say there is nothing, if you open it, you go, and if you close it, you turn on the app.
Truly our tanky.. Who took this lovely combination that we are proud of and not ashamed of wherever we put it??? Our Olive Young
Oh, they really are a perfect combination for each other ㅠㅠㅠㅠ All-young is really good at her job ㅠㅠㅠㅠ My bankbook is empty.
Olive Young has a really great eye ️ Is there a model that suits a drug store as much as a hot celebrity tankie who is popular with Nolto these days. If there is anything, I have to go or turn on Olive Young with Tanky in the future. Every time I see Olive Young while passing by on the street, I just want to go in and buy it. Pro-idol Nolto’s older sister and older brother who get along well The most anticipated rising star Taenggoo Kibeom and Olive Young are the best .ᐟ .ᐟ
I almost screamed when I saw the commercial for the first time,,, the video is so pretty and Tanky is prettier and it's perfect ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I will leave my routine to Olive Young,,,, I love you,,,,♡
Tango and height are so cute... I wonder if I brought two people who are hard on self-management.... They have a warm tone of voice.
Two people I really love ㅠㅠ I wished we could do an advertisement together someday

Advertisement!! From now on, whenever I think of you, I will run to Olive Young. Long live the Tanky Siblings!!
Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom are both geniuses ㅜㅜ Originally, I skip other advertisements without seeing them, but when the Tanky All-Young commercials come out, I see them to the end.
It's the best tanky combination with good self-management ㅠㅠ Praise All Young's eyes, I'm running to get All Young right now
The real Olive Young teacher, choosing these two as models will be the best thing you have done this year.. I thought I had to throw away my fandom and buy it because people who are really good at self-care are advertising.. I went to Olive Young with my mom. I swept about ten thousand won!! Olive Young x Tanky Let's hit the jackpot!!
I praise you for your true eyes... ︎ A tanky model who is sure about self-management is a great model.
A routine that fills your stomach~~ Kibum and Taeyeon's combination is a true story. It's so good~!!!!! I ran out of skin, but believe in the model and buy a skin from Olive Young Go Go Go~~~ All Young is the best
Olive Young is like a genius. It's really the best because it seems like I've chosen one female/male celebrity who takes good care of everything and sets them up as models... !! That's why I want to believe in it and buy it ️️ A few days ago, while I was going to another place, I saw the two of them and found me entering the All-Young store... Olive Young and Tanky are the best!!!
Tanky combination, what can you say, what do you do ️‍ God Live Young has the best eyes Knowing what fans like, and bringing both of them as models What should I do? What should I do? ..
I usually compliment the cj who hired me as the two models who take good care of myself. I think the sophisticated image they have is perfect with Olive Young. I use Olive Young often and I think I will use it more in the future ️️ Let’s get even more successful in Tanky
All-Young is a really excellent model selection!
It was so cute to see the combination of the two in Mt. Nahon. ㅠㅠ Even in Nolto, the two of them dance every week and they are really cute... I'm in great favor with this combination.
What's wrong with the color... Pink and green go so well together ㅠㅠ I really like the tanky siblings' chemistry these days ㅠㅠ I enjoyed watching it on Nolto, but it even reached All Young? This means that soon you can rule the universe...Tanky Siblings × Allyoung... Do you feel like you have conquered Korea? We're going to conquer the universe, so get ready...
Kibum and Taeyeon are both so pretty TTTTTTTTTT I love Olive Young. Now I only go to Olive Young every day.
I can't stand the tanky combination, so it's perfect as an All-Young model .. I usually go to Olive Young, but when I heard that Tanky was a model, I liked it so much, so I go or turn it on when I need something. best
They really look alike!!! How can this be? I want to go all year round right now
Tanky....it's crazy. Thank you for taking all of us crying babies.
And the things that protect my happiness are tangoo and kibeom
Tanky really is the best combination.. ️‍️‍ Olive young really.. Thank you ㅠㅠ
Two people who manage everything well and are good at their jobs, advertise clearly
Oh my god, on horseback ㅇ<-<
Kim Tae-yeon x Kim Ki-beom Kim brother and sister chemistry is here~
They're both managers, so Olive Young's image is perfect.
Originally, Olive Young is like a mill where you can visit even if you don’t have anything to buy.
Nolto's best combination Bonnie & Clyde!!
The concept is perfect too.
Olyoung's eyes... I commend you, don't you think the Kim brothers and sisters are perfect with Olyoung ㅠ__ㅠ ♡
Thanks to the tanky concept, I think I can protect my skin well!!!!!!! take my money
Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-beom, Olive Young Advertisement, person who suits you best..
All young as a tank ㅠㅠ!! Really the best combination
Nolto held an event to commemorate the Tan × Key Olive Young advertisement model, so I came to watch the advertisement video again.
Tanky is crazy ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
I've never been to Olive Young, but thanks to KEY, I got to know the newspaper Olive Young.
Midnight delivery is great, and the Olive Youngseo items are also very good. Tanky firing
The tanky chemistry with Allyoung is perfect!!!
I saw an advertisement for Tanky and immediately ran to the Olive Young store and bought it ><
They are both very reliable models ♡♡
Tanky Kim siblings are the best... ️
Olive young will do better!
The store song is also a tanky song, so I am very impressed.
Key fighting!
Thanks to Tanky, I turned on all the time and finished keeping my routine ️‍️‍️‍️‍celebrity is feeding me...Yes...Now, I eat every meal to keep my routine...Let's be together for a long time, Tanky...♡
Tanky combo is the best
I love you Olive Young!
Olive young is absolutely amazing ㅠㅠㅜㅜ It’s a tanky combination ..ㅠㅜ
The culprit gets hit in the face.
Our Olive Young who knows the combination of certainty •• Every time I saw Tanky passing by, I fell ill with an All-Young bottle. Take responsibility (｡ ́︿•̀｡) Tanky X All-Young Forever ️
They both look so fresh and pretty ㅠㅠ
ad is so good
It really is a perfect concept in today's times!
I've always thought of Olive Young as good ( •ૢ⚈͒⌄⚈͒ •ૢ) Teachers, I believed the charm of this era's charm idol, a tanky equipped with sophistication and sense. Our Ki-beom believes in and makes many purchases. I'm going to the mill or turning it on. Once again, CJ is praising your true eyes, and every time I see an advertisement, my mouth is tearing. I love it so much, is this paradise?
I was moved because the advertisement was shot so beautifully... It came out so beautifully~!~!~!
oh my god!! On horseback..!! I know that there are still many full videos of Tang & Key. You know that everything made up of a Tang & Key combination is a jackpot. I hope you only walk on the road to becoming rich.. Now you will only see the light.
Both of them are sure to win SM award... Tanky brother and sister, face, voice, main job, nothing is not perfect. Thinking that your eyes will brighten every time you go there, just... just... overwhelming gratitude.
It's the first time I'm happy because I've been pinging... It's sweeping ads...
Tanky, who is good at self-management, is not an all-young model.
To be honest, I don't go to All Young that often, but Tanky is a model, so I have to go with my wallet.. I see a lot of All Young commercials when I watch other videos.. Every time an advertisement comes out, I hope it doesn't end with a smile on my mom. .
I still go to Olive Young more often, so I go there more often ️ (I live abroad, I buy it with my family and order it online ️)
Taeyeon+Key is perfect !
Really happy to see their collaboration
There's no way it's not the best tank combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
The all-young image is perfect for taeng-goo and Ki-bum, who makes you want to buy it no matter what you use, is a great combination.
The devil makes me watch this ad whenever it comes up ㅋㅋ I even forget to skip the ad.
He's really cool. He was originally an idol among idols everyone knew, but he didn't give in to that and was surprised to see that the age range to know the two of them widened while promoting in Nolto. Haha I was wondering when someone would use these two representative icons of self-management as advertising models, but it’s Olive Young~… Olive Young is a genius! perfect! That's cool! ( ´͈ ꇴ  ``͈)੭⁾⁾·°˖✧˖° Looking forward to Olive Young and Tamky’s performances in the future!! I'll give you some money. #let's go
The true refreshment is you... All-Young model's eye is the best. Every time an ad comes out on YouTube, don't skip and watch it... Don't pass by the tanky poster hanging on All-Young.
It's really a tanky combination.. How did you come up with the idea of ​​bringing these two together? Really, All Young is a genius full of talent, people who manage it well advertise All Young, so it's very reliable ㅠ!! Every time I see our Kibum being managed, I think it would be great to advertise Olive Young.. I thought it would come true.. I am still amazed when advertisements appear on YouTube and TV.
What's going on with the combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like it. I want to go to Olive Young often!
All-Young... People who know something... The combination of these two, what can you really say~.... Genius people... I love you
Tanky casting is a godsend .. I went to Olive Young and saw the poster it was attached to. It suits you so well ,, I will go to Olive Young more often in the future.
It's a tanky model. Olive young really knows something....
Tanky Combination...it has to be perfect ㅜㅜ Thank you so much..
The tanky combination is the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ His looks are insanely dazzling
I think she's a model suitable for All Young. It's so refreshing, harmonious, and perfect hehe.
Taeyeon unnie is so pretty and Kibum is so cute too hehe
I really like the tanky combination haha
The tanky concept is really cool ㅠㅠ Olive young, who uses the fresh and lively tanky as a model, I really appreciate it. I love you.
No, that's right.. Do you think Olive Young is more trustworthy because fashionistas who are good at self-management are promoting it~? I'm really tired.. What if I do this well? Today, I chose to go on the go or on the go, so I bought some steamed rice. After all, I have no worries about what to buy hahaha~! Tanky and All Young always do well
Usually I went and bought Olive Young, but in this advertisement, Ki-beom told me to go or to be tall, so I immediately turned on the Olive Young app and ordered it!!! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha well
Tanky is an advertisement model so hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Be happy for the rest of your life to use these two as models
The tank combination is absolutely the best! Olive Young was the best choice.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
As soon as I started the video, I was breathless.. I like it so much I really like it, thank you so much. Thank you so much for making it possible to watch commercials with tanky combinations in my life.
The concept is so good! Taeyeon and Kibum did a good job casting!
I'll even make something to buy at Olive Young.
It’s Sowon and Shawol, but I’m so happy that the two of us filmed an ad together ㅜㅜㅠ Thank you for filming the ad beautifully!
It's so flashy because it's tanky :)
I often buy them at Allyoung~!
Tank Combination Choi


Go ️ I love you Olive Young ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
It's even better when people who are top self-management do it ㅜㅜ
Is there any model that fits better than these two?
It is an excellent choice with nothing missing from going on and off or from advertising texts for Olive Young to model selection for all routines in the world!! I can feel the saying that the eyes are strong while watching the advertisement!! After watching the video again, I have to go to All Young today.
The All Young x Tanky Legend combination is the best! The model image is good, the advertising concept is fresh, and the video was fun to watch! I love you olyoung!!
Ha no, Teacher Olyoung... .. you know what I really love.,, tanky brother and sister All Young, this is not an advertisement , Could it be that I couldn't get out of All Young? Thank you, I love you I Love You Umjojo~ Actually, I am a house lover.. I will use the All Young app in the future.
A tanky combination that's perfect for a real Hellview commercial...!!!!! Even so, I pay my bankbook periodically every year... These days, I go in several times a day and the shopping cart is calling well, hahaha!! Shall I take care of it too? Tanky combination that makes you think
Oh really, Kim Ki-beom, Kim Tae-yeon, they both get along so well, and I feel like I'm not really from another world...
And
No, no, the best chemistry in the world, the best chemistry between the Kim brothers and sisters is All-Young's model ㅜㅜ It's such an excellent choice.. They're really hard-working people, so they're interested in something more and want to follow them for nothing. What's your sense? It's still very hot, so I'm going home to grow olive young
No, that's right~ I wish I could do something for the two of you~ I wish I did~ You cast these two in Olive Young, what was it~? Even if you go or turn it on, it's a custom advertisement for the order of the house. Yesterday too, I turned on Olive Young and bought a basic product. As soon as I grow Olive Young, the tanky picture is perfect! I really like it ㅠㅠ Olive young is the best, tanky is the best
Where is this advertising planner really headed? Shouldn't we be paying paid vacations and bonuses?

Ki-bum and Taeyeon-nim saw an advertisement and came all the way off as if possessed. It's an advertisement, so why is it refreshing?
The casting is perfect and the commercials seem to come out really well ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I want to see commercials on TV, and these days, I watch TVN BOM every day (I think it will appear a lot on TV)
Tanky is really the best. I have to give my bankbook to Allyoung ️️️ I love you, I love you Tanky, I love you Olive Young ️️️
Self-management Genius Manjae All-young who uses the tank combination is also genius Man-jae... All-young goes and turns on and wastes his fortune ️️
These two pretty girls get along so well~ Go Olive Young or grow up!! Perfect for comments
If it's tanky, I've said it all.
Protect my wallet ㅠㅠ Save my balance, I have to go right away ㅠㅠ
Our tanky is so cute... Thank you all, I love you
If it’s tanky, someone shoots Olive Young commercials ㅜㅜ Olive young, who is self-managed, goes well with tanky, I want to follow the tango and i want to imitate the height, but if it’s the combination of Bonnie & Clyde, I think I’ll go once for this year and twice ^^
The best combination of tanky in the world The best company, Olive Young, the best idol and concept artisan, Tanky ️
You said you were thinking of bringing this combination,,,ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Tanky is love
All-Young's Eyes What!!! Take all my money, Olive Young, I'll give you a lot of money!!! Support the tanky siblings
People who take good care of themselves are models, so I have more trust and want to buy something more for nothing. I want to turn on the app once more and go to the store one more time. Olive Young × Tanky is forever..☆
I just ordered this morning as a dream today!! From cosmetics to eating and drinking, Olive Young is always with you in your daily life!! we'll be together for a long time
(If you purchase more than KRW 50,000, you will receive a tanky photo card..? It would be good..!)
Every time I pass by Olive Young these days, I see a tanky
Let's go in
Tanky combination, what do you say? Singing is singing, dancing is dancing, and visuals are all-young models who don't miss out on anything.
Every time an ad appears on TV, I just cry because I love it so much All Young is the best
I go to Olive Young every day, my favorite celebrity, Taeyeon, I am so happy that I am a model, I am happier because Olive Young is doing well
Our tanky is so cute ><
Immediately,, All-Young departure,, All-Young like my home,,
A good combination of people who like it so much ㅠ...♡ I really love you...!!!!!
Bonnie & Clyde To be able to see this perfect combination in an Olive Young commercial, All Young officials are very discerning. What can you say about their voice and appearance~~ They modeled people who are good at self-care and put their faces in the All Young store, so they passed by even when they had nothing to buy. A magic that goes in all year and picks up one by one...
The two are perfect all-young models.
Being able to see the best combination tanky I meet at All Young is the greatest luck of my life••• My quality of life has been rebuilt by going or turning on Olive Young.
No, I just saw this. Tanky beauty, what's going on?
I love the tanky combination in Nolto, but it's really great that they even filmed an advertisement together ㅠㅠㅠㅠ They are both refreshing and trendsetters, so they fit well with Allyoung.
It's a union between Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-bum, so I can't not go to Olive Young. It's a fact I've known for a long time that Ki-bum is good at managing, and even Taeyeon unnie, who is synonymous with lovelyness!! Isn't Olive Young's model selection the best sense? It's really all-young's sense.. Until the day when all advertisers imitate Olive Young and use Tanky as their model!! We support Olive Young. I'm going to turn on All Young right now ️️️ I love you Giberma ️️
How is it that there are models that are so perfect and so soft?
It makes me want to turn on the Olive Young app right now.
Kibum tangoo both are concepts, outfits, visuals, and they are perfect with Olive Young~~~ They are both so refreshing that I can't believe they're in their 30s~~~!!
A combination of self-management queen and king, is this paradise on earth?
i love you tanky
Tell me, what are you doing? Olive young is very trendy to bring a tanky combination.
oh my! Kim brother-in-law X Nolto X All-young Lee Guild Chansung,,,,
The Kim brothers and sisters are working hard until the days of Nolto and Olyoung. It is just a god,,,, just a light,,,, Now, I can’t even imagine a life without Kim and I, Nolto and Olyoung.
Please live together for a long, long time.
Turn on Nolto when bored or need something, then go or turn it on! now required
The best tanky combination, both fit perfectly with All Young, and the concept is perfect ️‍️‍ All Young will continue to use it~!!
I love you tanky
oooh
I really like these two.. ㅠㅠ
Trendy honey skin chemistry Trinity advertisement....
I went all-young to see the two of them, and I bought a curl cream on impulse. Take responsibility.
Really ㅠ The chemistry between the two of the dance clubs is so good....... ㅠㅠ
As soon as I saw this on TV, my mom and I absolutely loved it!! The Olive Young app is very useful, but the two of my favorite people are advertising this ㅠㅠ Tanky combination is love.
Tanky combination crazy legs...
It's because Tanky, who is the perfect match for Olive Young, is a model, it makes me more trustworthy and catches my eye!
Even if you go in to see Olive Young without buying anything, if you look around, it will cost you 3~50,000 won! I will use it a lot in the future
thank you model
Olive Young's model is really good this time.
Taeyeon is so pretty, Kibum is so handsome, it's such a perfect combination ㅜㅜ
What the hell is this?
Our tanky siblings who take good care of them are Olive Young models.
Such a perfect combination and a trustworthy combination!!! If the steamed olives are the models of Olive Young, I'll give you everything ㅠㅠ Bring them all.
I went to Olive Young for an unconditionally successful and trustworthy combination, and it is repeating endlessly~!
Tanky Heung Hae Lee Guild Dae Chan Sung All Young's Best Bbb
The most revolutionary model of All-Young Model There is no other idol who takes care of herself like this I love All-Young

These days, if you go on the street and see All Young, you always go in and see it.. They tell me tanky combinations, what do they do? These people who are good at management tell me to go or turn on Olive Young.
All-young's ad model is tanky, so I'm going to run to All-young right away or turn on the app ️ I really love Olive Young, I love cj

These days, it's an All-Young commercial with two celebrities that I really like. Thank you to the advertisers.
Tango and Kibum filmed a commercial!!
This combination is great!! Wow, now I have to go to Olive Young or grow it every day!!️️
The icon of management and SM’s representative brother and sister duo, Tanky, is a model, so I can’t go there~? Take all my money!!
Tanky combination is perfect~??~??~? Confidence from his voice How can you not love Tanky!?!? Thanks to Tanky, I've become a bum all-younger~
Either I go to get a tanky polar or turn it on to take a polar by myself
The concept is perfect...
Since Tanky, who is a king of skin, is an all-young model, I go to Olive Young once... I love you very much Olive Young
Buy all cosmetics at All Young
I love you because Gibam is a model for Taeyeon unnie. All young is the best.
Kibum is really good
Eung-eung, thanks to the world's cutiest sparrows, Olyoung is my home~~
I turned it on and went and did everything today!! You need to know Olyoung's eyesight
Also... those who have learned...
When this ad comes out, I watch it till the end. The Tanky Siblings are the best.
I've seen it many times, but to participate in the event again haha
Have fun all the time Have fun tanky
I wish there was no alarm sound in the advertisement
I usually go to Olive Young, but it looks like there are more! Tanky fighting!!
I like the tanky model hehe I hope to do it for a long time
As expected, I've been aware of all of them since they were there except for the ones that weren't there!! All-young with a great eye ♡ You will never regret setting up our tanky model!! S♡NE Shawol, let's all save money!!!!!
Real tanky crazy combination all young sense
Two people who are good at taking care of themselves advertise Olive Young? It's just a call to rob the olive young~
Tanky is the best!~ Thanks to the model, I will go more often in the future All Young!
Why is there a saying.. There is a saying.. There is a saying.. There is a saying.. When you see a very beautiful person, you lose your memory.. Why is there such a saying.. When you see a very beautiful person, you lose your memory . Huh, what should I do? I lost my memory right now?
It's the first time I've come in person to see an ad... Do you have any talent for recruiting All Young?
All-Young becomes a tanky... How reliable is the All-Young advertisement of people who work hard in management?
My dear~~~~ Bonnie and Clyde of Nolto's second-generation K-pop legends Kim and I are all-young models><
Is there anyone here who is against the tanky union (Tang) ^^
Let's go well together~~~~^^ If the king of self-management who seems to use only the best things in the world is the All-Young model, you can live with confidence.
Olive young, who does a great job, why don't you love him?? A tanky that suits you sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo in love!!!!!!
After tanky human Nolto, let's become human all-young!! Kim brother and sister are love.
I wonder if there is a way not to love the two of them.. Work less and earn more
Fresh advertising models are crazy about Olive Young's choice...
I didn't pay for YouTube premium because my girl was like this, so I pulled off the ad skip button
Tanky Combination Pros!!!!
I really like the tanky combination~~♡♡
no yes
Go or turn it on or whatever, you can spend money on Olive Young, right? I'm good at that. Spending money
If you used the model as a tank, you should have been prepared for money.
Really, the concept fits perfectly, and everyone's daily life seems like that, so it's cuter and suits you better!!!!!!! I keep thinking about that video the moment I go to All Young hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
It’s so good to be able to see the tanky combination All Young, which I really liked in Nolto, what should I do if I don’t have Olive Young in my daily life?
I really like this All-Young ad ㅠㅠ I feel like I showed the combination of Taeyeon and height!! Besides, it's the first time I've seen an advertisement that's more persuasive and comfortable to look at without a feeling of social prejudice because there are people who usually work hard on management.
The quality of the advertisement is perfect There is nothing to say about the tanky face ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It gets rid of the hearts of fans like this really ㅠㅠㅠㅠ How long did you go all-young after being selected as a tanky model... Yesterday I wore a palette, but I'm going to go buy tint later hehe The atmosphere of the advertisement is also You are so pretty ㅠㅠ All-Young is so good that you can purchase various branded products directly on the Internet without going in person. It is very convenient because you have everything you need.
It's great to be able to see the tanky combination at Olive Young ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Olive Young officials, thank you for using Tanky as a model. The ad is very addictive ㅠㅠㅜㅜ
Tanky and Olive Young are love ️️
It really is a very wise and excellent model choice. It is contrasted with the theme of going or turning on a tanky, which is really perfect for the topic of management in daily life, but flows in the same way, keeping the theme of the advertisement and without losing the subjectivity of the model. Anyway, I love it so much, I believe it's not a one-time thing.
Be with Tanky forever Olive Young
The two look alike, so the same picture is too cute ️ It's been a combination I've liked before, but I'm so happy recently because I even filmed an advertisement.. Tanky unit Kazuah who said that he rowed when the water came in.
Truly the best combination tanky! You are using Tanky as a model like this.. Put your forehead on Olyoung’s true eyes ️ Trust in Olive Young has increased dramatically as you use the rookie of self-care, Taeyeon and height as models ️ In the future, cosmetics, snacks, and household items will be sold at Olive Young. I'm going to go to the store or turn on Olive Young to buy it! And it’s a small opinion that if you do a good event such as poca with a tanky combination, the sales of All Young will probably go up even more ><
Can you use a tanky combination as a model? Olive young is the best..! The concept is very good, and Taeyeon and Key came out so well, so it's really good ️ I'm deliberately passing by Olive Young to look at the tanky poster... It seems like I will have to go to Olive Young often in the future...
Ha, so good All-Young Tanky Combination ㅠㅠ Good self-management, high self-esteem, nimble, sensible, early adopter Taenggo & Key Combination Nolto & All-Young & Tanky May we be together for a long time
I really like this combination..️‍️‍ How did you bring in only those who fit perfectly with the image of Olive Young!! Thanks to you, whenever an ad comes out on YouTube, I don't skip it and watch it until the end~!! I love you Olive
Congrats on Olyoung for recruiting a model as a real tanky brother and sister~ ㅠㅠ When I think of self-care, the two people that come to mind are models, so I have more confidence.
It's nice to meet people who gave me strength in my routine at Olive Young.
the model looks so good
Really... Two people with great self-management are advertising, so I want to buy them too... Personally, I really like them, but I love them in TV commercials and YouTube commercials I love you Tanky ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I love the tanky combination! As someone who enjoys Nolto and often listens to SHINee and Taeyeon's songs, I think it's a fantastic collaboration! Olive Young I will go again soon. Tanky All Young. May both of you always walk only on the flower path ️
The final king of self-management, the Kim siblings ㅜㅜㅜㅜ The image of the All-Young brand is so perfect. . . ️️ Every time I see an advertisement, I follow Tanky and I challenge myself to live a fresh life!!! I'm shouting hahaha
The really best combination,,,,, every time it comes out, I don't skip it, and I watch it all the way to the top of the ad
The king of self-management, Tanky is the model. CJ's Kim siblings who go well with Olive Young Personally, on the way home this summer, when I don't have the energy to listen to Olive Young... When I have something to buy but it's too hot to go out and I'm dying.. One person who turned on Olive Young frequently. It's so comfortable. Going to or turning on Olive Young like Tanky
They both have a perfect concept, and I thought that Kibum and Taeyeon would like to collaborate in a cosmetics commercial someday, but it's Olive Young!!! Especially since I'm a real fan of Olive Young enough to make it almost every day ㅠㅠ Thank you so much ️
Healing every time you see an advertisement on real TV
The best friend's association that suits you so well🖒
The perfect tank combination!! The best ad you can't help but watch!!
All-Young is with me day and night, inside and out, outside and inside! With All Young and Tanky, we can go anywhere
It's so good that two people I really like filmed an advertisement together.
Oh my gosh... I knew that there was an all-young app thanks to Tanky Oh~ The fact that I found out about the Dream Service today thanks to Tanky! Ha ha ha
Two people who are really really good at management are models, so trust is high! Is there something that makes you want to buy? Oh my gosh, you picked the all-young model really well~ haha

ㅋㅋ Buy a recommended item, Minsu, Minsoo, Beom, Minsoo! I can do it!! ᄏᄏᄏ The two people in the ad are really pretty.... It's clear. It's clear. It's like opening your eyes...
Taeyeon's height..perfect
The combination of the two is absolutely amazing... It's the best combination of the second generation.
natural
I'm tanky
I really like the tanky Bonnie and Clyde combination... I really like it as if I'm about to collapse... I have to be very excited.
All year long, I go there often, but I’m going to go there more often... Even if I don’t have anything to buy, I’m drawn in by looking at the poster outside, and the magic that comes out with both hands ~ Magic Magic I’m going to hear it again soon haha... (But Pokana...Pocca... ,If you give me some goodies, I think I will go more often...)
They're the models that go well with All Young. After watching this video, I just remembered the products I was going to buy at All Young, so I immediately opened the app and ordered it again! Tanky really the best model..
It goes so well with Tanky All-Young and I like it perfectly.
Be with All Young Tanky for the rest of your life
please
Combination tanks that are pleasant to look at are both the best models!!!!
Wow, Taeyeon is really cute... Taeyeon's key combination ㅇㅇ Who made it? It's like a Nobel Peace Prize?
Tanky, you are my routine and my life
I really can't get over this ad when it comes out ㅠㅠ Tanky's beauty is so shiny ㅜㅜ
Wool tanky~ You even tore up the All Young advertisement~
Thanks to you, I robbed the olive young yesterday. I...
Torn my bankbook.. I love our tanky
Where is the person who picked this combination (?) Your choice was perfect.
Taeyeon-ah always keep a healthy routine with Olive Young
Key, fighting too
Still, I used Olive Young a lot, but thanks to my tankies, I think I will go more.
I really love you Olive Young, only walk on the flower road. I use the app well. Tanky ℒᵒᵛᵉ ᵧₒᵤ...
I really have to give an award to the person who decided to be a tank for the all-young model really, the concept suits her so well ㅠㅠ️ It’s the first time I’m really excited to see an all-young commercial when it comes out after watching TV haha ​​Thanks to the commercial, my bank account balance too.. Olive young with tanky as her commercial model Love it
I really like the tanky combination, I really like All Young, which the top influencers use these days ️ I really like it
All-young does a good job... To use Tanky as an advertising model... Thank you so much, I love you, Tanky brothers and sisters, they are really cute... Yes, yes, you all do it.
I can't fail the tank combination ㅠㅜㅠ What's the all-young sense really ㅜㅜ I've robbed my bank account!!!!
The real Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon who asked me to be a model, work really little and make a lot of money ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Let's become a real human canoeing human Yanadu, Kim brother and sister, human all-young!!!
A face genius who does everything pretty and handsome, the best combination tanky...
Since when did this video have to be 30 seconds long? It was played infinitely so I didn't know ㅠㅠ It's too short, so give me more...
The stability of similar shades and the voices you want to keep hearing even after listening to them
You're the first to raise the corners of your lips every time a propaganda comes out..
Although Olive Young is always by our side, the model is tanky, so it is more familiar and makes me want to go there often! A few days ago, I bought a basic product at a special price by only turning on the app. Olive young tanky model Please use it for a long time I love you!!
Kim brother and sister tanky I love them ㅜㅜ The two look alike, so they look like real brothers and sisters Olive Young CJ Idol Kim brother and sister with employee ID card! I turned on Olive Young, but it's not in the delivery area, so how should I go? So, where did Olive Young’s tanky goods come from? Is there something like Pokhara please? Yeah? Yeah?
The concept is good and the chemistry between Kibum and Taeyeon is perfect ️
I shoot well in commercials!!! Kim Taeyeon & Kim Kibeom’s breathing is the best!! Kim’s younger brother is great!️️‍
It's really cute. It suits you so well!!! I really like the sense of stability that comes from Allyoung x Tank x Key ㅠㅠ If this is the case, I can only go to Allyoung...
The combination of Taeyeon and Kibum in this video is so perfect!
I miss Taeyeon unnie's Vietnamese fans a lot
The last tango solo cut is really crazy, crazy,,,
But I really love Tanky.. I love Tango so much.. I like Kibum too.. But I really love Olive Young.. I was going to go and buy it today.
As expected, Olive Young who knows the trend!!! The selection of an advertisement model is amazing?? There is no reason to go all the way to Taeyeon x Key combination, who is good at self-management and full-time job.. Here is someone who has already spent 100,000 won.... Today too I go to Olive Young after work.
The best chemistry of this era Kim Taeng-goo Kim Ki-beom Siblings ️‍ The two people who are the standard of management are all-young models.
The All-Young model is great too, but the commercials and directing are also good. Tanky Fighting All-Young-chan
Olive young has become a daily routine and a daily life!! A place where you can meet all the products you need as if you breathe, even the model selection is really perfect. Loyalty in the future!!!
I'm not the only one who can't get past this ad when it comes out right?
I said Ki-bum saw me, so I went here for the first time in a year... But Taeyeon-nim is so pretty that I tried to steal 100 pamphlets and only brought one.... TTTT It's really good.
Olive Young, who invited Tanky, is the best. Please use only olive young from now on.
How can you not love Kim brother and sister...I want to go on or off, I will do both.
If you're shooting an ad with a tanky combination, you can't use Olive Young, right? All my routine is Olive Young I love you Tanky
The real tanky is so pretty. People who like tanky fold their fingers and the earth is folded in half.
Became a tanky commercial model and I'm taking Olive Young attendance stamps every day... Olyoung is an advertising genius, Kim Taeyeon Kim Kibeom is also a genius model.. ♡♡♡
I love you
None of the tanks can be released, so let's just turn it on as we go... ️‍ Turn on and go, go or turn on!
tanky is life
Hehe, a very good tanky♡ You're a fantastic partner
Oh my God, it's a tanky commercial ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
No, the person who selected the advertisement model, please accept the Nobel Peace Prize ... Thanks to Olive Young, the world has become fresher and the harsh world has become more peaceful ... My eyesight was 0.1, but suddenly my eyes opened and I felt like I was 2.0. What is this feeling? We work less and make a lot of money. Kill our tanky.
Taeyeon x height I really like the real sibling force Olive Young chose the model well
The best olive young with the best siblings
People who like both Taeyeon and height in the tanky ad are moved by it, so it's a shame ....
Tanky has a certain sense of trust... I think it fits well with Olive Young...
Today, I went to Olive Young and I went to Olive Young or turned it on, Tanky Huay Tang
The tanky combination is a legend... Happy all-young who took an advertisement with a tank, thank you ㅠㅠ!!
The tanky combination is a legend...♡
He's like a CJ's son!!@ Kim Ki-beom, do better. Get a higher salary and be happy for the rest of your life!!@
I come out frequently on TV. All day long, in front of the TV is mine. This advertisement can only be digested as tanky.
Isn't it a tanky if you manage it? I really like Olive Young, but it's a tanky combination!! 923 times the joy
The chemistry between the tanky siblings is really crazy ㅠㅠ You can't go wrong with Olive Young now, right? Let's only walk on the olive young road
Taeyeon and Tall, who show the sibling chemistry in Nolto, are filming an ad together!! This is a combination that has no choice but to succeed, but I am so happy that I can now see Taeyeon at Olive Young near my neighborhood. I will use Olive Young more in the future.
Tanky... Combination... Awesome... ♡
A tanky combination you can trust and see .. ♡ Thanks to these days, even if you don't have anything to buy, you always check out All Young and come out with one in your hand.. Thanks to you, you're discovering hidden gems.. All Young + Kim Ki-Beom Kim Tae-Yeon Everything is great!!!
The tanky siblings are so perfect
Before I saw the Nolto clip, when the commercial came out, I cried while watching it because it was so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's the best ㅜㅜ
Really the best combination, just light,,,
Best advertisement model Tanky Olive young, the best without words
Or go to Olive Young on the way home from work! On days off, turn it on at home! I go or turn on, isn't it Olive Young, the best restaurant in my life ️ Even if I lose the chicken in my life, I can't lose Olive Young •• Let's go or turn on or go with Tanky.
The two top celebrities I like the most are doing an Olive Young commercial, so it's really good and perfect... Still, I go to Olive Young often, but the image fits so well that I think I'll go there more often in the future ️ The model selection is really good!!
tanky ball friend
I always support Olive Young, I love you oh oh oh
How do you know that our tanky Kim brother and sister union is so cool ^, < Lately, I pass by Olive Young on the way to work, and I go to work watching Tanky once in a while Gooyoung goes from morning to buck~ I really love Olyoung and the perfect combination hehehe
It's a meeting between Choi Ae and Choi Ae, so it's fun to watch and it's an advertisement with people who are self-managed.
Humble tanky, you are my love
Because of Tanky, Olive Young is more refined than Mac Dior Hera Lancome, more luxurious than Hermes, and literally ‘Young’
All-Young who picked Tanky is really the most discerning Ki-beom-ah, the bagel chips are really delicious…
Olive young model Cha-am was chosen well..
The best sibling chemistry, Taeyeon, Kibeom, who was chosen as a model without being taken away from others.
Actually, while working as an Olive Young employee, I often thought that it would be good to have a new All Young muse, but I am so happy to see Tanky All Young like this ㅠㅠ..
Taeyeon Kibum's daily routine video recognized by Olive Young staff!!!!
I can't lose the tanky combination, thank you, Olive Young, the best brand of this era
I love you all young, your model suits you so much
As soon as I clicked on August 1st, I ran and came from Olyoung. You are the best brother and sister tank in this era.
Tanky's best self-management men... CJ has found the perfect advertising model...
The tank combination is the best....... ꌩ‑ꌩ Olaf Young is the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Kibum's concept is perfect ㅠㅠ I love the tanky combination
It becomes this combination ️ I will sign a life contract with the ad model tanky siblings who stick to Olive Young
Olive young is just life! Is there Olyoung?! Even if you don't have anything to live for, you can go in and buy something~ Olyoung to look around! Usually it belongs to “go”, but these days, it seems to be “on” a lot!! When I heard the rumor that they filmed a tanky commercial, I thought it was really good, but the commercial came out cutely!
No, my past me, as soon as the advertisement video came out, I ran to see it and got so many likes, how did I not get a ripple?
A combination that I love so much... People who take good care of me are all-young models, so it suits them really well.
Seriously, when this ad comes out, I keep watching it like I'm enchanted.
I love you best combination tanky
The best thing you can do is check stock at All Young's official mall..
Tanky, please be CJ's daughter and son for the rest of your life.
I like it so so so so much human olive young tanky
The tanky combination is the best ㅠㅠ Please really debut.. Olive Young goes every day to look at the tanky poster ㅠㅠ
I really like Tanky ㅜㅜㅜㅜ His voice is stuck
I need to go to Olive Young more often.
Go to or turn on to keep the routine. Advertisements are so addictive ️
My iPhone battery performance deteriorated after turning on or off the Olive Young app all day.
Tanky is an all-young model... This is truly a unique combination. Seriously ;;
Ideas for selecting this combination model Work less and earn more
Thanks to Tanky, I am able to shop more and more often this year ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Tanky is so pretty,,
Tanky, Olive Young
Nolto's siblings ️Bonnie and Clyde ️It's so nice to see the tanky combination you trust and see at Olive Young ️ In a Kosi soup like these days, I'll "turn on" Olive Young today ️
Oh my gosh, I see you filming commercials with tanky combinations...
All-Young is really trendy and has eyes.. How did you come up with the idea to use the All-Young ad model for the Tanky Guild in ancient times!!! Really great casting
A very, very lovely combination...️‍ㅠ The best brother and sister tanky commercial shot Young-doo Olyoung-doo is so lovely.. Perfectly perfect ️️ Thank you Olive young went on or on, I already did both..
Best tank, best all young
Ah, Jincha Tanky is perfect! All-Young Why are you calling me now! Haha I've been waiting for a long time...♡ Tanky with no jokes in both chemistry and visuals! I'm looking forward to the upcoming videos.

My favorite tanky combination ♡
It's nice to see Kim Siblings' Guild every week as Nolto, but even Olive Young!!!
It's an advertisement with King Taeyeon and King Kibum~~♬♬
Even if you skip other YouTube ads, you can't skip this ad, no, no
Seriously, why are they both so pretty and handsome.. I go to Olive Young often, but I need to go more.. Because Tanky is a model, trust me and go All Young!!!
Yes, go, go, go, go, and do both... Kim Ki-beom's pink is perfect...

Ki-beom Kim is always at the base of my Pungbi Parksan, I ran to Olive Young on the news of a tanky advertisement and bought all the vitamins I don’t normally take, I don’t have money to eat, I only eat vitamins and chips that Ki-bum ate at Olive Young you can live
The best self-managers of this era, I love you every time we go~ It's fun to see the faces of the Tanky brothers and sisters.

My eyes are so happy to be with you as an advertising model like this.
I always use All Young every time I buy cosmetics and I need to use it more often All Young is the best!!!
Very good tank combination
Olive young very joha
I go once a month
I think this ad is really well made
Can you stand still while modeling for Olive Young?
I'm going to pick up the olive young to buy the product I've been wanting to buy!
Thank you to the Olive Young teachers for recognizing the true model...️ Thanks to you, I see Ki-beom's face at Olive Young every day on the way to work and go to heal..! Olive young I love you the most, Olive young
Shooting an advertisement for my favorite brand with my favorite combination... … The two of us are seeing good chemistry in Nolto too, and it’s so nice to be able to shoot a commercial like this... . I'm so satisfied as a mom.. I'll run right away all year long ️️️
All-young is the best!
I really believe it because people who take good care of themselves are advertising it. Olive young with the best taste that I know of Tanky Guild This is the first time I've ever liked an advertisement. I'm going to Olive Young right now ️️️️
Since we filmed a commercial together, how about singing a song with Bonnie & Clyde? I think it will be a hit hahaha
I love the tanky combination with a perfect visual and a great voice!!
They really look good together as all-young models... Two tanky models, Olive Young, I give you the best praise ㅠㅠ I love Tanky the most ️️
The day comes when I see an All Young commercial with a combination of two real tankies... I wish I could live a long life... I'm so happy!!!!! I think I'm going to watch the ad for the 5 trillion and 5 billionth time hehe Olive Young and Tanky are just perfect for themselves Olive Young and Tanky are just light I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Olive Young does the best job in the world!! It's the best tanky union for self-management, so you can trust it more and buy it at Olive Young. Take my bankbook~!!
I really like the tanky combination~ I really love All Young officials
Totally refreshing tanky combination, so Joa Olive Young also has an eye
As soon as I heard that CJ's son and daughter and Nolto's tanky siblings were filming an Olive Young commercial, I saw it right away!! I came to see Nolto again because Nolto held an event for the tanky siblings ️ Tanky who takes good care of himself and has a great chemistry!! If you make a poster for the pocanas too, I'll run to Olive Young to buy them again..
Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon can't lose their brother-in-law chemistry ㅠㅠ Advertiser's excellent eyes Cheers~~ Olive Young originally went a lot, but I will go more in the future.
Chansung of Tanky Siblings Guild, Cheongdam Kitchen Nahonsan, and Nolto and Olive Young~~ You can't see this combination, right? Olive Young goes to work every day to see Tanky ㅜㅜ He plays Tanky's song twice a day.
泰妍跟key實在太適合當代言人了,兩位都把自己管理的很好,也位過生活
This combination is so good!
After all, the kings of self-management!!
It's a tanky combination.. I really can't get over this!
please take my account
Tanky is so pretty ㅠㅠ It's perfect for All Young commercials
I have to go to Olive Young or turn it on or both
No, my god, tank X key combination Bonnie & Clyde on horseback, until advancing into the advertising world!!!!! Olive Young is more sincere in this union than anyone else.... He has an excellent eye. Stakeholders!!! Let's unite Korea with coolness by meeting Cheongnyang X Cheongnyang. If the testimonials are like this, it's a combination that will just go away..!! Olive Young was really one of my favorite places, but I guess it was all fate....My sister went to Olive Young on Taenggoo TV and just swept it in the basket...!!!!!! Did you see it???!! This is fate and love. ️ May Taeyeon X Key X Olive Young all prosper. Be happy
After watching the ad, I found out that Allyoung can deliver fast within 3 hours, so I even tried it.
Can ads be this cool? Every time I pass by Olive Young, I see Tanky, who is the best in self-care, and naturally go in and shop! Olive Young decided to use Tanky as her model! I love you
The Tanky Siblings' Olive Young advertisement... It's the best advertisement for Olive Young by two men and women who manage it well. Tanky-chan Olive Young-chan ️
I can't stand the Bonnie and Clyde tanky combination...
They both go so well with Olyoung.
You look like a genius for the tangi combination.. Taeyeon and Kibum have a genius face too
Our tanky siblings look like human Olive Young...️? It's steamed and professional self-managers do it, so it's so perfect... The people involved in the advertisement did a good job.
Kim Ki-bum and Kim Tae-young are great! Olive Young is the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I love you Olive Young ㅠㅠ
Olive young is very discerning for bringing the tanky siblings first ️ It suits the advertisement so well
Tanky X Olive Young... such a perfect combination♡
The combination I love the most ㅠㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Tanky is the best ️️️️️
Seriously, I can't not go to Olive Young ㅠㅠ All young is the best... it's thrilling
Who suggested the tanky combination ㅠㅠ It's so perfect, I'll love Olive Young in the future tooTT I love you All Young I love you Tanky!!!
Tanky Gaecheon Recipe Olive Young, you are working hard, casting is perfect
It's an advertisement for two people who go well with Olive Young!!!!! Olive Young is usually familiar, but thanks to the commercial model, I want to go to Olive Young more.
I use it a lot every time, but I will use it more! Tanky Sibling Chemie
Kim Ki-beom, Kim Tae-yeon.. The day is coming when Tanky will rule the world. The first step is to complete the Olive Young registration. Haha These days, I am doing all the small shopping at Olive Young.
Every time I watch TV, I get this commercial and I'm happy ️ I'll go to Olive Young often
Pink and green ️ Tanky is perfect because the color of Olive Young suits you so well~~~ 100 points of this combination
You're so cute ️️ With Tanky, Olive Young is available to keep your routine.
I clicked like and subscribed and watched the video too. I really want to get Tango unnie's Polaroid! I love you olive
Tanky I really like this combination. When I go to All Young, it's covered with tanky photos, so I really like it.
tanky... ..ᰔᩚ A combination I love so much♡♡ Olive Young is the best Thank you so muchᰔᩚ I'm going to get rid of Olive Young! The best of All Young Kim Tae-yeon Kim Ki-beom the best
The Tanky siblings are advertising Olyoung...Is this how I can't love Olyoung...

Tanky and Olyoung rule the world...
You are so pretty, Kim brother and sister combination is the best testimonial ️
It's an advertisement with a tanky combination ㅠㅠ Olive young is the best I'm going to buy it right now ️
The visuals are great, and the voices are great..
I want you to be a model for tanky for a long time..
What's going on with this? Ann Clyde X Olive Young ㅠㅠ Did you change your mind because you wanted to make money?
You did a good job in casting Olive Young, and you shot a good advertisement. Congrats~~~ Go
turn me on!
Oh My God.. Kim Taeyeon.. Kim Ki-beom is an All-Young advertisement... You have become a son and daughter of a true, proud CJ.. Be with CJ like crazy.. I love you Tanky Olive Young Choo oh CJ is the best ️‍
How can you think of letting the kings of self-management shoot advertisements between you,,, Olyoung has the best eyes
Tanky combination is crazy I really like the advertisements of the management kings~!!
Olyoung and Tanky are love
The day will come when I can happily watch ads without skipping hahahaha
How in the world can a tanky brother and sister who are human Olive Young itself be a model...
The best advertising model... so pretty today, go on or off
The concept fits very well, and the tanky is perfect for all-young!
SM's official siblings Kim Taeng-goo X Kim Ki-beom The Olive Young with the best models is really the best. The concept fits so well... If two people who are thoroughly good at self-management are models, you can trust Olive Young more and buy more. I go to Olive Young often, but if the two brothers and sisters I love are models, I would go there very often... And their voices go well together. It's the strongest combination in the universe. Tanky's chemistry already knows everything, and Olyoung's eyes and sense who picked that tanky are really the best... ..even though the order of the words is a bit jumbled, I'm really, really, really happy, so I'm gibberish...
Tanky combination is love, the best of All Young
Olive Young chose the perfect combination <3 It's so pretty
Every time a tanky commercial appears on TV, Shawol's heart is majestic.
Tanky is Olive Young’s perfect rice cake! I'll go or turn it on or use it comfortably :)
After seeing this, I will go to All Young
I didn't even go there before, but I got a model certificate~~~ You did a good job TTTT
The tanky concept suits you really well Olive Young Thank you End of the day
Tanky combination is too tight
I watch it whenever I think of it.. The best model, the best combination. I love you tanky♡♡♡
Olive Young robbed my wallet
This video is always good. I love fresh tanky.
The concept is perfect and the chemistry between the two ♡ Please give me lots of All Young goods I love you
Olive Young, who has chosen the tanky brothers and sisters, who are new to their main job and self-management, as models, is very insightful.
People who are really good at management tell me about it in advertisements, so it’s more reliable and it’s tough! What's wrong with their looks ㅠㅠ They're so pretty, they're so handsome
The K-pop Bonnie & Clyde Tanky that goes so well with Olive Young = The best combination All Young seems to shop more often ^-^
I'm happy..I'm happy.. The commercial was shot by Tanky, and I'm dying of joy as if I was paid for the ad. Who was the person who cast Tanky? Did you get a promotion? If you have this kind of planning ability, you can be a boss. Tanky-chan.
Olive Young does the best job in the world ,,, the Kim siblings do the best with her face...
I turned on Olive Young after seeing Tanky. Skin care this summer is with All Young & Tanky.
Tanky combination is the best!!!!! I have a reason to go
Tanky... I write tanky and read it as love.
Uh where are you not hearing anything? The sound of juice bursting~ Even just watching the video, the juice is bursting
love...
tanky... . Go my routine… my energy... I will only walk all the way...
Tanky is so pretty ㅜㅜ Olive Young is the best!!!
I'll go to Olive Young too.
I love the Kim Siblings union ㅠㅠ Ollie Booyong..
I totally support this combination of Kim Ki-beom and Taengoo unni's collaboration!! Olive Young is the best TTㅠ I'm visiting Olive Young while playing Soshi and SHINee's songs...
To be honest, I work hard and do well as a manager, and as a result, if Taeyeon, who is certified as a broadcasting medium, is a model, even if she is a model, she puts trust in products she doesn't know.
Taeyeon and Kirani ㅜㅜ It's just a fantastic combination.
I believe in tanky combination!!! Kim brother and sister I love you All Young is the best
Amyoamyo All the routines in the world are All Young Oh haha ​​It’s a tanky commercial, so I’ll use it more often!! Hello All Young & Tanky!!!!
Tanky Steamed Siblings Union Merseon 129... I have another reason to go all-young hahahahaha I only walk the CJ money road
This is a declaration of war by the kings of real self-management... The image of Olive Young has improved, and the Olive Young app was the first thing I learned through a tanky advertisement.
It's a tanky union with Olyoung, whom I check every day ㅠㅠ So, so very happy Sowon Shawol is crying ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm not going to take my work stamp at the company, but now I'm going to take it in Olyoung. best!! From now on, let's only walk the all-young road ️️️
A tanky combination you can trust and see!!!! I love you Olive Young~!~!~!~!~! Go or turn on, All Young is the best
Or go to Olive Young in the first place! turn it on! I used to do it, but after Tanky (Bonnie & Clyde) became an advertising model, I learned a lot of good things, so I use it more. Because it shakes the hearts of the fans with various contents, the favorability of All Young is up up up! Let's continue to go all-young in the future! turn it on! I will do it, so please love our tanky brother and sister a lot
It's not a joke to trust because the tanky idols with the best management are advertising All Young... My favorite celebrities are models... I want to work at Olive Young... I can't work, so I'll spend my money... ..
Olyoung-nim, thank you for recognizing the tanky combination.... Really the best. I use it regularly, but now I have only Allyoung at a cosmetics store. Thank you so much.... We are proud of Bonnie & Clyde Fighting ️️ We are proud of SM ️️
You did a really good job in the cast ㅠㅠ The tank combination is absolutely the best!!! I keep wanting to go to Olive Young because they advertise Olive Young as a tanky combination.. My heart wants to buy a whole bunch ㅠㅠ
Kim brother and sister Kim Tae-yeon and Kim Ki-beom union!! Do you know everything? As expected ... Every time I pass by, Tanky leads my feet .. The sound of singing moves my hands and I lose my mind. Every time I go out, I buy a bar and come out!!! Besides, if you see an ad while watching YouTube, you're right!! Then, go back to the All Young App and go to Dream Today!! 👌👌👌 Thank you all~!!
The best brand of this era, Olive Young ️‍️‍ The ultimate self-management king, Tanky, says it is necessary to keep the routine, so the real credibility rises by 923309%!!!!!!! From now on, give me more tactics, rob me of my wallet!!!!!!
Wool tanky♡ I love you forever
The chemistry between the two goes so well together! As expected, the tanky combination is a combination that you can trust and see ️ Not only in Nolto, but also in the advertisement, this combination shines. You both have very nice skin and you take good care of them ㅠㅠ All Young tore this advertisement!
“It’s just life” Your Taeyeon’s virtue is my life!
Thank you Olive Young.. Take away all of my wallet.. The tanky combination is the best ㅠㅠ
To be able to see Tanky together in one advertisement ㅜㅜ It's really the best I totally support Olive Young
I will be a slave for all young people. Thank you for using Tanky as an advertisement model.
Kim Ki-beom, Kim Tae-yeon, what do you say... ️ Your selection of all-young models is really excellent ㅠㅠ Gibeom tangoo who is good at his main job, commercials, and entertainment, always fighting
Olive young advertised with people I love ️ I am so happy to be able to see the long-awaited tank & key combination at Olive Young ️‍ Magic that makes me sniff every time I pass by Olive Young... I wish I could see more tanky combinations~~ Olive young Let's be together with Tanky for a long time ️‍
Tank Combination....the best
Both concepts are perfect.
Olive young used often
It's absolutely golden ♡
The proud jewels of CJ, the best brother and sister of K-pop.
Since the kings of self-management in the entertainment industry are all-young models, it can't get any better than this.
They're a fresh couple... I've only used Olive Young so far, but I will only trust God Live Young in the future.
Olive young tanky is the best!!!
I love you tanky!! I have to watch this ad every day. Is there an ad on TV? I just watch it without turning to other channels Taeyeon Kibum is pretty, so tanky as a model for a long time!
This model is so pretty!!! I love this combination ♡♡
Thanks to Tanky, I got better all year!!
Kim Tae-yeon Kim Ki-beom A combination of the best Kims of this era Olive Young Let's continue to be together
Tanky~~~~~~!!!!!!♡♡♡♡♡You are the best.. The strongest chemistry ever. Perfectly perfect. Rice cake. Bean model!! I went to see Tanky's face a long time ago
The tanky combination is great. Using a person who manages well as a model makes me want to imitate him. Olyoung does a good job
Olive young has another go-to.
I'll be going all year round today to see Tanky Yongan.
Health and beauty, don't miss it
The CJ One Roof Cousin Channel Nolto event also came up and I came to see it again 'b')/ Tanky Kim Nam-mae Vocal combination is love.
Olive young....I love you, Tanky, please take care of me in the future. I will visit Olive Young often.
Olive young keeps tanky's routine
All-Young App Today’s Dream also protects my routine. Praise me~~~
After all, doing the Olive Young tanky model is really the best marketing. Please do the event quickly. I'm dizzy, so take all my money.
I love you tanky (´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
  (Kim Tae-yeon X Kim Ki-beom) Brother Kim gets along really well with Ol-young.
It has been about 18 months since the door of consumption was closed due to the economic downturn caused by Corona... Has the desire to consume ever risen like this? The word “longevity idol” is an old saying… Girls’ Generation’s Taeyeon and SHINee’s Key, whom I met in middle school, were older sisters than me at the time, but they still overflow with vitality and energy… The tired and sick one is me who becomes a worker ant and stays behind the screen. .... I feel a sense of crisis.... Let's follow them and speed up routine management..! Actually, on Monday, I went to Olive Young to buy snacks and perfume.... Yesterday I bought Olive Young's 'turn on' basics.... What is this impulse...? No, this is not an impulse, but Taeyeon and height are what saves me.
Who came up with the tank combination??? the first

May you rise to the top, Olyoung × Tanky forever!
Olive Young, who loves the Kim siblings
A fantastic combination created by Nolto.
Tanky's best team.. I support you
These two are the best combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ All young, ten days, ten days, all young, great country
This combination is crazy, it's perfect ㅠㅠ
Tanky..so pretty...thanks Olive Young. I didn't know I would like the ad this much...heh
I'm just proud that the tanky siblings who are good at taking care of themselves are doing such a great advertisement ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ ㅠ — yea , ​​I really like these two .
Question: Who is the best advertising model in this era?
Answer: My name is Olive Young, Kim Tae-yeon, and Kim Ki-beom!
I've liked Tanky for over 10 years... ㅠㅠㅠㅠ They are completely siblings themselves, but after all, a large corporation like CJ really appreciates it?! Tanky is already top class in K-pop, but let's get more excited! If you just follow the tanky routine, you won't grow old, right?
Tanky suits you so well!! There is no one who fits the Olive Young model as well as Kibeom oppa, how passionate are you in managing it ㅠㅠ All Young staff, thank you for being my oppa's model.
Let's go Olive Young as a lifelong model
The tank combination is just crazy... I'm going to Olive Young right now
Tango and Kirani ( ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ ) My... I love the Bonnie Cloud tanky combination...? Anyway, the best tanky chan
Makes me search for advertisements with my own hands...I really like the chemistry between the two of them, but the model CF was so pretty and cute ㅜㅜ Olive Young does a great job bb
How can advertisements from people who are sure to take care of themselves like Tanky be unreliable? I used to use All Young often, but every time I see it this summer, I can't pass it up and walk in. Olive Young and Tanky are love!
Kim brother and sister are so pretty!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Olive Young!
Thank you so much for the tanky combination hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Look at the tank!
The combination of real woman Kim Ki-beom and man Kim Tae-yeon is so good. If you are pretty, I will only let you walk on the road of money and flowers!
I usually bother going out to buy things, but thanks to Tanky, I found the Olive Young app. Both of them are good at self-management, so the reliability of Allyoung has skyrocketed... The combination of Allyoung × Tanky is perfect, the only thing I can think of is that they are human Allyoung... I wish you all the best
Ah, the tanky brothers and sisters are so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Take my heart ㅠㅠ
Aigoa... Aigoya... Aigoa...Doremi Dandong Bonnie & Clyde Tanky did it!!!! All-Young Teen Mother Advertisement Model is perfect for coming...♡ And I love Kim Ki-beom
The concept is so perfect and it's really nice to be able to see the chemistry that I've only seen in Nolto here.
Let's sing a song as a collaboration!!! Tanky!!!
Tanky ... Love ... Olive Young ... Genius Manjae
Tanky chemistry is so good ㅜㅜ I killed the Tanky siblings
There are no other people who are well-received by pink and green. The very fresh spring atmosphere flows so well with the image of Olyoung.
Unable to open your eyes
Gibam...it's really perfect ㅠㅠ Tango is so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Tanky siblings let's live forever ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Olive Young is the best at her job... She's the best. A combination that wipes out my bank account...

Kibum and I have a happy birthday with Olive!!!!(ͼ̤͂ ͜ ͽ̤͂)
I also liked All Young herself, but she's a tanky...
This combination is really my favourite.
Complimenting Olyoung for thinking of using Taengoo and Kibeom as an advertisement model together My wish to continue to model this... hehe
SM's elite siblings tanky!!!!!
Good luck to the advertisers from generation to generation ️️
Olyoungeun^^ It's just life~^^ The two of them talked about the Capital Department hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Advertisement with the sweet girl of this era, it can't be good, right?
I have a reason to be with Olive Young 24/7 all day. I will do my best to revive the Tanky Siblings and Olive Young.
To love Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde tanky is life.
I love you so much Olive Young!! I love you so much tanky!!
All-young has eyes.. How can you choose a tanky brother and sister as her model!! I can't stop going all year long and I can't turn it off because Tanky, who is the king of self-management, is advertising. All my money is stolen..
I love Bonnie and Clyde!!!
0:22 Standing up for my tango beauty ㅠㅠ Tanky brother and sister perfect combination
What's wrong with the face..?!?! Tanky combination is the best! The voices are so pretty, I keep watching the commercials... When the All Young commercial comes out on TV, I'm blown away. I love the advertiser. Thank you for allowing me to see these commercials.. I want to run to All Young right now because of Tanky..! Haha
Kim brother and sister always support you

Olive Young, take my bankbook
The two very pretty people advertise for All Young, so I go to All Young more often than I used to. They are both so pretty and perfect. Every time I watch TV or cell phone, I get an All Young advertisement. do
Trust Tanky and go only to Olive Young.
People I like advertise it, so I can trust it, and I see it even once on the road, and I sniff out if there's anything I can't buy. Teng Teng Tanky Teng Teng ️‍
The perfect combination... Those who learned Olive Young.. How is it so perfect ㅠㅠ
Nolto Entertainment X Tankive Young forever ️️
I love Olive Young... The two of them go so well with All Young and their chemistry is great.. ㅠㅠ Thanks to Tanky, we went shopping for Olive Young after a long time and either went on or off.
Let's go right now, Olive Young. Turn it on right now, Olive Young app.
We are so happy that our Tango and Kibeom and their Kim brothers and sisters filmed an Olive Young commercial ㅠㅠㅠ
The comfort that comes from the same shade, the same tone, that’s Olive Young I love you
It's an honor for Popmons' team Bonnie & Clyde to win the Olive Young model.
Tanky siblings.. shooting an Olive Young commercial..
The best brand All Young Tanky Combination Ad is very good
Tanky, I love Mani ♡♡
Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde All-Young accepted.. All-Young, who took the tanky union first, is a real genius. Genius... There is a reason for everything that works well ㅠㅠ Let's win more with Tanky from now on!!! Shopping is all-young, all-young is life!!!!!
Ah, it's an advertisement for a tanky combination ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I know it's better if we do it together. I really love Olive Young.
Kibum is now cj's son
All young is the best ㅠㅠ Nolto's Bonnie & Clyde tanky combination is the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Tanky is just life ^^
Tanky Guild Best Olive Young You do a good job ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooble
I've already seen the ad as soon as it came out, but it's good to watch it again, and it's so good if it comes out as an ad in the middle after watching YouTube.
Olive young model tanky is perfect
Seriously, I'm sorry to hear that you're choosing the Tanky Siblings as models.
Tanky Chego-ya, let’s go in front of me
Wow, it's the last time hahahaha When the wind blows ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ You're so pretty unnie eeee
Oh it's so good~~ It goes really well with Olive Young

Bonnie and Clyde Tanky, the best brother and sister union of this time, is on the rise ️‍️‍ You know that it is more trustworthy because it is an advertisement run by two people who are good at managing the world!! All young and CJ are the best...
The tanky combination is really.. the perfect casting
Tank Combination
Truly the best advertising model tanky,,,,, ㅠㅠ
<3 good
CJ's children tanky Kim brother and sister union is the best ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Now I go to rob Olive Young every day!!!!!

With the tanky siblings, Olive Young looks fresh, green, and refreshing... ️
Go or turn on All Young
A tanky combination you can trust. Go to the end of this combination!!! Magical advertising model that makes you go once, go five times
The advertising model is absolutely the best. I put it on Olive Young because people who fit in with this lifestyle type of advertisement are advertising it.

I can hear the money coming out. Tanky is the best, Olive young is the best.
You really get along really well with two people who usually take care of themselves, Olive Young..
Thank you, Olive Young, Taeyeon ㅠㅠㅠㅠ In the meantime, Taeyeon's voice looks good.
They are so pretty ㅠㅠ.. I'm so upset that Olyoung isn't here here ㅠㅠ
You're so pretty and handsome, one of the few interim ads you don't skip while watching YouTube hahaha
The narration sounds like the lyrics of a song ㅋㅋ Since you have a good voice, just listening to the audio is fantastic, but seeing the crazy visuals together is the best!!!
Testimonials.... Is there any other model combination that goes well with the advertisement like this? Every time I see it on TV, I feel so happy!!!!! Tanky is love
You've become CJ's son by being steamed. Gibam ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm so proud of you ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
No, the real advertisement was also selected perfectly.
WHY THEY DONT HAVE OLYOUNG IN MY COUNTRIYYYYY
Key believes and follows. If you buy what is recommended, at least there is no failure. Go to Olive Young
I love Tanky, who also robbed Olive Young and robbed me of my heart..
Ah, I can't go without Olive Young.
I will attend every day from today ^ ^
The advertising model is absolutely the best. I can hear people spending my money on Olive Young because people who fit in with this lifestyle type advertisement are advertising. Tanky is the best, Olive Young is the best.
Thank you, Olive Young, because our Keybeom is a model ㅠㅠ Prepare me for money!!
As expected, the tank × key combination~ It suits you so well! Let's be Tank x Key forever!!
The tank combination is truly amazing.
I'll bow in the direction of Olive Young's headquarters.
Be sure to turn it on when you go to Olive Young ㅠㅠㅠㅠ♡♡
I really like the tank combination.
I still go a lot this year.
I have to go more often to see the faces of the wolves
Taeyeon Kim really. TTTTTTTTTTTT
Our tanky resurgence project~ Olim the sparrow, who has already been there all year!
I believe in tanky commercials, I think Olyoung and the world go well together~ I~!! Because Bonnie & Clyde advertises, I know what it feels like to want to go to All Young more.
oh my god!!!!! Why only model now!!!!! No, even now, praise Olive Young. Let's go shopping right now a a
Ah, the real Tanky All-Young commercial is so perfect
Wow Taeyeon unnie and Kibeom oppa what's going on!!
Yesterday, after Noltoboda, I was shocked when this ad came out hehe I go often this year and I think I will have to go more in the future!
Ah, Taeyeon is so pretty ㅠㅠ She gasps when she sees the ad.
Let's go crazy, full-faced commercials, Taengoo and Kibum, and All Young's commercials look good together ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I really like this combination~~ Praise All Young!!!
Finished watching, the Kim brothers and sisters are so perfect
Self-approved managerial job tanky advertises Olive Young ?! Reliability rise to full level
Tanky lights up the world.... I am really... so... Thank you for all your hard work....You do a better job than SM. Work less and make more money.
Are you filming an advertisement with a tanky combination ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
You did a good job of getting an advertiser.. Praise Olive Young.
The combination of Tango and Kibum is the strongest in the universe.
Taeyeon's beauty, which had been neglected at home, is illuminating the world after Nolto. I'm so happy!!!
Let's deodorize the tanky unit that's perfect for the all-young models of the brothers and sisters Kim!
Cute, cool, adorable
Taeyeon x Tall, the perfect match for Olive Young!
Awesome tanky combination.. Love the cuties and thrive in Olive Young. Good Good
I found out about Key's variety show, but he was really cool when he was working full time!
Are there people who are so perfect for real beauty?
The more I look at them, the more they look the same, even their faces, personalities, and even their surnames ㅜㅜ Aren't they just siblings? brother and sister
I went to buy cosmetic basics that I didn't even buy to see you guys..It's so perfect. I love you.ㅠ
Combination of Tanky and All-Young
Kibeom x taenggoo combination is love
The olive young that Tanky advertises, no, you can't go on or turn it on, right? Olive Young’s model tanky brother and sister who want to go or turn on right now, it’s perfect ️
Olive Young recognized the height of a man who knows how to take care of himself...
I will change to Olive Young at Innisfree.
Taeyeon is really beautiful
Bersyukur banget taeyeon eonni masih punya key oppa, selalu berharap semoga taeyeon eonni sehat lahir dan mental, Aamiin
The tanky combination is absolutely the best. I go there often because it's in front of the company All Young. Every time I go, I look like tanky, so it feels great!
Tanky siblings
They look really good together. Perfect human olive youngs.
Who is the real Kim Ki-beom and Kim Tae-yeon chosen as the model? Be happy all your life walking on the money road ️️️

Kibum gets hit by the low tones ㅠㅠ What do you think of his voice?
Baby... I love you... Princess Princes...
A fresh girlfriend has arrived!!!!! Well, the advertisement is refreshing and refreshing.

=========End of Crawling===========
Review the review corner, the idea is so good ㅠㅠ
It takes a lot of time to find and judge reviews one by one, and I have trouble deciding.
This corner is so useful.
I also love you Olive Young
Allyoung explains in detail so that you can feel the texture directly, and you can see reviews felt by other users, which saves time shopping and lets you see cosmetics that fit the trend at a glance!
It was an opportunity to check the product more easily because we were able to share the color development formulation with users' reviews.
In particular, in the case of lip, it was difficult to check the color development in the store, but you can check it in detail, so it was a time to check even the parts that could be missed in the store.
Thank you so much for challenging me while making new corners ㅠㅠㅠㅠ There are a lot of sales, but above all, all the staff are friendly, so I go to Olive Young every day hahahaha In the past, I was so sad that ROMN didn't come out. I was lucky enough to see it, and it was really nice to be able to color it myself before anyone else ㅠㅠ I saw a see-through matte tint for the first time this time, but I have to go see it again. The color is easy to predict!!! Thank you ️
Review speed As a quick-tempered person, it's really good to quickly pick up a summary without feeling frustrated hehe It's an All-Young that I trust and read, even the review .. Perfect itself ️
Congratulations on coming back after being renewed all-young!! Fill your feed with newer and more interesting content
After being remodeled as an All-Young TV, it looks more trendy and feels like a friend who comes to us easily ️ In addition, the fact that you are making a color version of the Rom & Hanbok edition that I was most curious about.. So touching ️ I was worried, but after seeing your review today, I made you a dream today.. Everyone, do 1 all-young a day.. ️ I tried the new snack Delight Project Choco Cinnamon Bagel Chips today, and I'm really crazy!!! I would like to review it on All Young TV!!! It's really the best.. Delight Project's sweets, people who didn't eat fools ️️
Koduk was delighted to see this review~~Yeah! I hope the day comes when I can see the mask and show off my lip color.

The fact that there are many reviews means that it is a platform that many people use! Thanks again for the cool tip
Tamra is easy to organize and easy to view, and I love that reviews are provided so quickly and neatly with only the information you need.
Wow, review a review that I can't help but praise!!! First of all, it is good to be able to see how much sincerity the product is being sold, and the part that allows you to objectively see subjective reviews is also very good. It's already full of virtue, but it makes people around me have the will to do it too.
Oh my God, the reviewer's talk on the horse Merseon 129••

In addition, the pace of development that makes you feel comfortable
Wow, it's so nice to review each one so carefully. You can only check the color in the store, but it feels like everything about the product, from smearing to color development, is captured in the video!! This is a video that really suits the era of untact.
What's so good about rom&n is that there are many cool-toned items ㅠㅠㅠㅠ rom&d shadow palette dried buckwheat flowers are really cool. Tim
sleep anyway
It's a yellow-red contrast..... Oh, you're short again. I was just looking for a light color.
As expected of All Young ㅠㅠ It was hard to see each one because there were so many reviews, but now I can easily see reviews of products I want to buy.
It was so good because it seemed like an honest review because you gave a detailed introduction to the tint, such as design, formulation, durability, and disappointments!!
I don't go to Olive Young often, but the staff at the branch I went to were friendly and explained well, so it remains a good memory. The new look is very nice.
This reorganized content is much more attractive than the existing All-Young TV content!!
In fact, if the speed is slow, I often end up skipping 10 seconds back.
Since only the necessary information is extracted from the review column full of steamed reviews and shown with detailed product cuts, I think you can purchase it right away without looking for other information just by watching this video. That is attractive.
Reading the reviews one by one and directing them according to the reviews, the feeling of immersion is no joke.
The review is also divided into chapters, so it's very useful, and it's very useful because there are also tips and tricks.
It's a perfect review from the last discount event to just one piece.
After reviewing the review, I can't wait for the next video!
The rom & coral color is really crazy ㅠ
I usually ignore cheap cosmetics.
If you look at this, it's really better than the price these days
I think it's right to look at the productivity.
Sincere congratulations to the new Oliver ^^
The tints are colorful and pretty ♡
Olive Young's hot days..ㅜㅜ I tend to look up a lot of reviews before buying anything, but I really like this neat review video.
This is a very useful review video because you can see the color, texture, actual color development, and even actual user reviews in the video, even for parts that could not be explained in detail through the website description!! Looking forward to a good review video in the future!!
It's nice to be able to compare the pros and cons of each one at a glance by putting several reviews together in the video. These days, I've been experimenting with masks to make sure I'm completely arranging all the things I'm missing out on. It's really good. Watching the video of what's in my shopping cart makes me want to buy it, so I'm going to go buy it soon. Of course, God Live Young!
Olyoung, you really learned a lot. From the beginning, you focused as if you were possessed!!!! There are a lot more reviews than other places, so I tend to refer to them when purchasing, but I would like to ask for more reviews like the filial son who collects extracts like this and scrapes off the parts that I was curious about, such as the formulation and color!! Olelujah
Entering the beauty category
I think Olive Young is definitely following the trend these days :)
I think that the real Olive Young review is a detailed review without sponsorship, and I am the person who buys the product after looking at the Olive Young review all the time, because everyone was so kind and even left the details I was worried about.
I really liked the rom & water tint too, but this time a new hanbok edition came out, so I'm going to have to buy it again.
Olive Young's new look is even better!! hehe
I think it's so good to review a new review and to be able to see the review extract like this ㅠㅠ
When I buy a product, I always read reviews, but seeing the reviews I have used myself, I think I can buy it with more confidence!!
I want to see a pad review as the next review product~~
We look forward to seeing more diverse and useful information and products in the new year of Olive Young!!
A very pretty tint case like a real pastel hanbok and a matte color with good application.
All-Young's new look is so pretty~ It feels like reviewing reviews and verifying corners, so it's trustworthy, so I think it's really good! The lip product review was full of corrections, so I couldn't understand the color, but the color is honest, so I want to buy it.
I've been diagnosed with personal color these days and I've been looking for reviews on color cosmetics, and All Young TV is really helping. It is a channel that you must stop by and look for videos when purchasing various cosmetics other than color.
This is the channel I go to before I go to All Young, but review the review!!!! I like the video speed, the description dictation, and even the review itself.
After watching episode 2, I felt a new world and came to see episode 1 at the speed of light!!>.<
As expected of the largest drug store, All Young's big data must be so accurate that it cannot be ignored! All-Young is always ahead! Not only Olive Young Day, where you want to see if there is anything left, but Olive Kit as a gift that comes every month, and the hot All Young Festa at the end of the year.
A variety of events that cannot be replicated anywhere else, and a convenient live interface that keeps pace with the times will surprise you every time! As a prime example, Olive's new ticketing is getting fewer and fewer errors, and it's becoming possible to participate in a different level of convenience than in other labs! The hosts, the technical team, and Rayo also played a part! :) Looking forward to it!
The content that understands the consumer's mind is so good hehe I think the color of Rom & Tint is really pretty ㅠㅠ
It was cumbersome and time consuming to visit Olive Young and look for reviews one by one, but it's great to collect and review all the hot items on All Young TV! Even fast and accurate delivery keke The best rom& that I trust and use>< With Olive Young, accessibility is better and I really like it haha
The review speed is very simple, but it is very good to be clear. Please post a lot of good product introductions :)
All-Young's new look is so pretty and new!!!
The speed is good, the voice is good, the video is so good ️

I look forward to the product review video by olive young sales ranking
Wow... This is a really heartfelt review ㅜㅜ I really appreciate the new refurbishment of All Young ㅜㅜ Even these days, I have been looking for a lot of rom & hanbok editions.
When it comes to tinting, after all, rom&! The color development is excellent and I am very satisfied with the adhesion to the lips!
It's nice to meet you on All Young TV!
Please continue to "review reviews" of more diverse products on All Young TV!
Rohmn, famous for tint introductory items, has worked again,,,,
What I like the most is that it is planned by ROMN and can be bought at Allyoung ️ I support all young,,, ROMN,,, both
And writing the release date of ROM&N is really impressive!!
I just thought it was necessary, but the execution power is great!!
Hahahaha It's clear that they're a young group.
Knowing the trends and always doing what people want
clean it up As a rom & lover, the video was really good
(I want the hanbok edition)
Thank you for showing me such meticulous and detailed information, it really helps me a lot in purchasing. Isn't it a rom & tint restaurant? It's a hanbok edition, so the design is really hanbok-like.
The longevity and color development are very good, and the mask does not smear and this system product is acknowledged hahaha!
The words are clear and stick well in my ears.. I use All Young online a lot, so I think I'll put it in my shopping cart even if I don't go to see it in person. It's useful and it's good.. Have fun
Allyoung's new look is so pretty haha
The new reviews are so good.. heh detailed and good explanation
It's also nice to quickly review according to the trend.
I'm going to buy rom and tint~!
It's great that you explained the reviews in detail ㅜㅜ
Congratulations to Olive Young.
I don't like tint because of the dryness, but rom & tint is the best because you don't have to worry about that.
The one who planned the Hanbok edition right before the Lunar New Year is like a genius with an idea.
ROMN's product power is also product power, but the design is always so pretty.
Thank you for the really neat review and only useful information
It's not like I'm praising it, it's the best all-young review restaurant by comparing the pros and cons.
Romn and Allyoung are working really hard,,,,,Michota,,,After the change to AllYoung TV, the video editing is also fresher and younger, so it's easier to watch!!! The magic of delivering a lot of information quickly so you can watch it to the end in an instant without even skipping 1
I watched the whole video until the end, I really like the video editing... Personally, I appreciate it! give!
The information is clearly visible to the eye and the colors are well captured.
I need to give my girlfriend a present for her upcoming anniversary!!
We always welcome and thank you for such valuable content.
There are many products that I see for the first time when purchasing products from All Young, so I always look for reviews before buying.
You are really sensible by reviewing the reviews️ Please review all the makeup products and tools quickly.
I look forward to it!
The color of rom and tint is really crazy. I bought rom and tint not too long ago.
Really meticulous and fast! You did a great job hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Whenever I buy a product for the first time, it was my job to look for reviews, but it's great to collect and review the best reviews like this TTTT I haven't tried Rom'n yet, but I really like each color one by one!!
Congrats on the new renovation of Olive Young :)
I really like the Rom&Hanbok Edition for its color development and adhesion.
I hope that in the future, you will meet more diverse reviews through AllYoung TV and that many people will be able to start a more beautiful day :)
Congrats on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review ^^
It's so nice to collect only the best reviews and introduce them to you~
In the future, All Young TV will receive a lot of love with better review content.
I will always support you.
ROMN's unique dreamlike texture and color are really pretty, and I think the package that captures it well is really pretty! And like the hanbok edition, I think our unique pattern is really pretty! In particular, the reason I fell in love with Rom'n's is that the cool tone colors are really pretty. I really like the colors that can be used well with all warm cools ㅠㅠ The tips are perfect for gradation, anyway, all of these are good.

Damn Olive Young's review is also the best!!!
The color is really pretty and the design looks like it came out really well with the style of hanbok.
In addition to that, the pretty color development and the long lasting power? It's really great. It's really good because there's no stain on the mask. Please show me more All Young products.
Rom'n's colors are really good too ㅠㅠ I use it a lot because it feels like the person who writes it...?
It's a really steamy review, so it's good that you can refer to it every time you buy~
Really ㅋㅋ The feeling of immersion is a joke ㅋㅋ The warm tone matte lipstick is pretty ️ All Young TV Heung Hae Lat >_< keke Please give me a lot of good reviews in the future! In particular, Olive Young has a lot of shampoo and conditioner items, but you can't try them in stores, so it would be good to see a review through a video!
I think it was really good to be able to see detailed reviews of various colors!! I kept thinking about the colors I always wanted to buy, but it makes me want to go to buy them right away hahahahaha In particular, water gloss.....cooking...☆I'm looking forward to a variety of reviews from now on!!!
The video itself is immersive, but the product descriptions and reviews are also good.
I will continue to watch All Young TV in the future.
It's nice to collect only steamed reviews and share them with you in detail with a video hehe It was very helpful for color comparison. I'll subscribe and check back often.
Steering the video over
See-through matte tint Tap once or twice with toilet paper and there is almost no stain on the mask
Durability is also excellent.
It's really nice to put the hanbok edition pattern there.
Makes you feel patriotic and classy
I'm really happy to be able to share a review that you can trust and meet through All Young TV :)
Let's all make beautiful and happy days together with Olive Young in 2021!
The newly renovated Olive Young YouTube channel is so cool and congratulations!!
Congrats on the launch by reviewing the review! Review the review! Advantages of the product
I picked it up quickly and without realizing it, 6 minutes and 39 seconds went smoothly haha.
From the design of the Rom & Tint Hanbok Edition, the design is so pretty!!
Most of the time, I can't watch this video to the end, but he explained it in a way that I could hear well and the speed was just right, so I ended up watching it until the end! Actually, I search many reviews and reviews before buying a product, and it's really annoying, but I think it's a great advantage to collect reviews written by people like this and explain them again! I think ‘Review Review’ is so good~! All-Young TV that seems to come and go often in the future!! I'm looking forward to this good All-Young TV. I hope more people will know it, so it will become more famous and more and more videos will be uploaded~! All Young TV Fighting!!!
The color development is really great. Wow, thanks to this honey content, it's so nice to be able to choose the one I want with the design, formulation, and durability that I want!
Looking at this video, there seems to be no tint failure.
It is a rom & tint color, color development, and even spreadability! There's nothing missing. I hope the Hanbok Edition gets a lot of love!
I'm back after being renewed all-young!! Reviewing reviews..! I hope the review I wrote comes out as well >< I have to watch it every week I have all of the rom and tint and lipstick, and the hanbok edition is also pretty, so I have to go for jahwang red and safflower coral It's amazing how well you're doing hehe I'll wait for the next episode! downpour!
It's the first time I've watched the review video till the end! The speed is good, the voice is good, the video is so good ️
I look forward to the product review video by olive young sales ranking
Rom'n is really cool, so this is a product that I have to use regularly,,
The new line is also great.. The design is pretty and I am very satisfied with the longevity of the formulation!!
I love how the video is neatly organized
This gift should be rom & hanbok edition-!
Congratulations on the new Olive Young channel!
It's so good that rom&n keeps releasing new products too~~
I liked it because you explained it in so much detail in the video!! I look forward to the detailed review on the YouTube channel in the future~ Thank you. I will cheer you on for success in 2021 as well.
Wow, the new makeup look is so pretty and new!!!
Gaeko's open studio, the only beauty YouTuber I see, Gaeko's Romanne...I can't really talk about it...it's so pretty ㅜㅜ
Toasty nude and Damju beige are my favorite colors, but there's matte tint...
Thank you for choosing and organizing only the best reviews! I think it's great because he talks so fast that he doesn't get bored! The speed is fast, but it fits the ear! Come in! We will always support All Young TV in the future!
Wow... I want to have them all ㅠㅜㅠㅜ There are no identical colors in the world ㅠㅠ
Best of all, it's great to collect reviews like this ㅠㅠ I'll come and check it out every day And praise God Rom &
I'm sure rom&n's color captures the color pretty well ㅠㅠ The purple red color is absolutely perfect for my taste. I like the gradation and it's easy to do, so it doesn't stick to the mask. I'm going to pay my salary again in All Young.,,,,
The speed is not good, but the review is meticulous ••• Really God Live Young Thank you ️
Congrats on the new Olive. The voice of the person explaining it is piercing my ears. The review is great!!
When you go to All Young, it has a lively and free atmosphere, so if you go, you will feel fine. The reviews are also collected as the best and you can trust them! After all, Olyoung is chubby~~~
A video that seems to understand why everyone is doing rom n rom n...
I'm tired of the color.
The best without asking the mask
Also rom &!! The color is really pretty ㅠㅠ I want to buy it!
I'm not going to lie, the colors are really pretty ㅠㅠ Especially safflower coral! It's too sniper to my taste. I'll have to run to Olyoung to buy it.
Congrats on all-young's new makeover~~ The tint color is so pretty!! Haha It's always good to see you~^^
Wow, I feel like I'm following all the latest trends. It's really great not to ask.
I went to Olive Young a lot while enlisting in the military and worried about my skin! I hope you continue to grow and do well in the future.
The event is so good ㅠㅠ By the way, in the room, it's my TT life tint ㅠㅠ I love dogs
A review that quickly informs you of only the questions you need and the details you need
All-young is the best!!
It's so nice to review AllYoung TV :)
All young staff are friendly and I love that they explain the product in detail to people with atopic dermatitis. I have sensitive skin, so it's good to take that into consideration and explain the product.
The color of the rom&hanbok edition is crazy ㅠㅠ If there is a review video like this, buy it right away!!! I wish there were a lot of review videos
Sincere congratulations on Olyoung's new makeover ^^ I enjoyed the video. Olyoung has a variety of products, so I'm going to search in advance what to buy. The review video is very helpful. I support Olive Young.
The tint is so pretty, especially safflower coral ㅠㅠ
I came in to participate only in the event without seeing the advertisement, but it made me fall in love with the tint advertisement.
The model's lips are so pretty... Really
Awesome from the case~ The light purple color is pretty. Lima I absolutely commend the reviews that are not boring in the eyes and in the ears. There are a lot of new lines for Physiogel Fortress, so please review them too~~
The lip color is really, really, really pretty ㅠㅠ This time, this time in the Hanbok edition, she's such a pretty child ㅠㅠ She's really pretty ㅠㅠ
Congrats on the new soy sauce, I always cheer for you hahaha Even if you wear a mask, lips are absolutely essential, but the best thing is that you don't ask!! Buy now><
I was thinking of buying a new tint, but from the design of the rom&hanbok edition, why is it so pretty? Mersun 129...
The color development is so pretty and I love the durability too. I really enjoy seeing reviews that are honest and not boring.
Longevity is really the best,,,, It's good to know that it is ROMN that puts the consumer first by being able to write down the opening date~ Personally, I like gradation lip, but it's really good to mix two ROMN products and apply it without putting it on the mask. Ghat Ghat.....
I ate dinner and got in the car with my boyfriend, but it's a lifelong item that made me forget that day when I was embarrassed because of my pale lips. I love the friend who recommended it!
I did all this when I saw the purple color ㅠㅠ It's a cool tone, so if I put on something wrong, my lips are floating and I'm thinking about what I'm going to put on this face, and it's been over a year since I wore a mask, but I need to put this on. I hope the day comes when I hear people say, ‘Hey, what kind of tint did you put on?’
Hearty congratulations on the launch of All Young TV
I will always support you with great strength!!!
I feel like I'm watching an SAT lecture!!!
Clear delivery of the product!!!
All Young TV!!! It's steamed!!!!
Wow... from color to durability, it's just the end...
rom n is love
I am very happy to have a quick and ears. This hanbok edition is also very pretty ㅠㅠ It's not a hanbok edition, but I recommend it to everyone who loves rom & see-through matte pink fold :)
All-Young's renovation makes the atmosphere very bright and nice to look at. I'll come to visit All-Young TV often from now on. I hope you have a great time in the future.
Yesterday, I went to All Young and asked for rom and tint ㅠㅠ My house is full of only rom and tint .. haha ​​I think rom n is the best tint among her friends !! It's my friend's birthday tomorrow, and I'm going to buy you some Rom&#x27;s cosmetics haha ​​The tint is really pretty, I love you Rom&
I really believe in Olyoung's sense... Thanks to Olyoung, I'm so happy to find her life items....
I really like the speed and the diction,,,, All Young TV user
As for cosmetics, I only stick to Olive Young, which I think is very good~
Olive young never disappoints, it's the best ^^
Huh....Rom&Lip is crazy....how can it not be erased???????? I thought it was a color restaurant
Room and tint is so pretty.
The color and design are my style.
I look forward to supporting you and looking forward to you in the future.
The person who planned this content should be rewarded!!! Whenever I purchase a product from Olive Young, I make a purchase decision based on reviews, but since there are so many reviews, I make a decision based on the latest reviews and photos. Putting it all together, except for the overlapping parts, exactly the bad points and the good points! And content where you can check tips

It is so good that there is For busy uploaders
"I'll collect all the Yogi reviews. You just have to decide." I love this planning ability that always gives new ones to the uploaders and scrapes the itchy parts!!! I wanted to buy Romanne after seeing it last time at All Live, but I got it as a gift from her friend, so I tried it. The one I used was jahwang red, and like the review in the video, if it's warm, it's cool, but it's a color that sticks to both me, who is a cool-toned person, and my mom, who is a warm-toned person. And since I am the only person who loves to touch the ball hehe I am using it as a ball touch in combination with a little foundation. However, because I have a lot of oil on my lips hehe I tend to get a little erased when I eat rice. Nevertheless, the color is perfect and, above all, it can be used multi-use with a touch of the ball, so I am still using it well. Actually, what gets removed can be different for each person, so I have lips that can easily remove all lip products lol.
Wow All-Young TV.. I really like the reviews and the speed hahahaha sales power is no joke.. I have a business to go all-young today.
2:05 Reverse play hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
ROMN and ALL YOUNG are both working really hard. As expected, my favorite brands...
The tint is really rom&.. the color texture is so pretty ㅠㅠ
Next time, please review the cushion foundation too!
The hanbok edition is so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ This is a review I believe in,,I'm going to rob Olive Young soon hahaha
Wow the tint color is so pretty
Write a detailed review quickly and perfectly
What are the rom and lip.. they are all so pretty ㅠㅠ
The desire to purchase more with the model's lips!
Yeonji Bora is a girl, but she is so atmospheric...
It's matte so the mask doesn't come off.
I often go to Olive Young, but there are so many products that I have a hard time choosing. Hehe I'm so glad the reviews explain it in detail hehe I've never used Room & products, but I'll have to go to Olive Young to buy it hehe I really like the purple rouge hehe
Wow all young rom and tint.... i don't think there is a tint that can match the real color TTTT so good :0
Real Rom & Hanbok Edition
Really so pretty
I really like Rom&#39;s products.
The real hanbok edition products are so pretty
Please look forward to many useful videos in the future~♡
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha run right now
All-Young This time, another jackpot happened! The hanbok edition and rom & tint are great ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'll have to run to check it out after work.
The review content is full of fun and fun! :) I always love Romanne hahaha
This is the review video I was looking for!! It was a pity that I couldn't test it at the store because of Koroa these days, but I think it will be very helpful in purchasing re-purchases by letting me know by tone, color, and formulation.
I really like the rom & zero velvet series ㅠㅠ
Also, congratulations on the new dress-up of All Young!!!!!!!
Wow, the best of the real review videos... detailed and beautiful lol
Not to mention, the rom & color development is so good that it sticks well.
When applied, the color is the same as the visible color without developing a different color.
I'm so excited to stay
The event is so good ㅠㅠ By the way, rom&n
Room and cool-toned items came out very well.
This hanbok edition is crazy... I want to buy them all
ROMN seems to have its own color, doesn't come off even with a mask, and the gradation color is the best!
These days, the color of Rom & Lipstick seems to be too stingy ㅜㅜ
The sense of finding the missing points haha
It's a hanbok edition, isn't the package too pretty? Especially in this current state, I am sensitive to the durability, but I am going to go all out for color development..
I enjoyed watching the video of All Young! Thank you for making a good product. We support!
I was really looking for a tint that didn't stick to the mask ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'll have to run to Olive Young right now and go to the rom... I love you all young ㅜㅜ!!
rom is the best
The see-through feeling is really good! Not the same, no frustration at all
really good
Rom&Tint makes a really good color and is of good quality, so I trust it...️
Wow, this is a really detailed and helpful review!!!
Believe it and let it go!
Romanne knows Koduk's heart very well,,,,,,,,,,,,
Not to mention the rom & color is pretty, even the case is awesome.
All-Young Room& is really making me rush.
The color is so pretty. It seems to follow the trend well! The application and color development are good, and there is no Yoplait effect.
Hut All-Young TV Good Review in detail and what is the speed?!
I love All Young ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I have all the rom&pact tints and I love them so much that I want to buy them again every time I run out of them!
As soon as I saw the video, I thought it felt like I had seen it somewhere..
It's a video with a style similar to Meat Man.
I enjoyed the fast and light video
Congrats on decorating All Young TV. You've done your flower arrangements, so this year you'll be even prettier, everyone♡♡
There is no failure just by looking at the All Young TV review~ I will go directly to Olive Young after watching the video~
The color of rom and tint is so pretty ㅜㅜ I think I'll review the reviews in the future and take care of the contents!!
Congrats on the new look at Olive Young! I'm really looking forward to getting to know useful information well in the future~~!!
Huh, to show you only the best reviews like this builds trust and the detailed cuts are clean and the speed is as unobstructed as a real highway.
A friendly All-Young who is always in a visible place! As masks are essential in the era of Corona, we also introduced tints that match them.
Rom & Zero Velvet is a jerk, so I wore it every day and bought it again at Allyoung yesterday ㅠㅠ I'd buy the hanbok edition, crazy, I reflect on myself for not watching Allyoung TV yesterday (੭ ˃̣̣̥᷄⌓˂̣̣̥᷅ )੭⁾⁾
Meanwhile, the model's lips are respectful,,ෆ⃛
When I bought something, it was cumbersome to search for reviews separately, and I bought it like a fascination after watching it on YouTube, but I started to watch All Young TV more and more!!
Isn't rom & a real color restaurant?
Hey, I love this corner. Those who dubbed after watching the video were so funny that they burst into laughter hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Rom&Chan takes care of all warm tones and cool tones! This hanbok edition is also great!
Review the first review! is a hallelujah~ Rom-men!! All the people who work at Olive Young are really cool... Preparing content like this... I fell in love with the speed first and fell in love with the last one... I'm a person who buys, but actually looking at the reviews, whether this is an advertisement or just to get points... There are many cases where I can't tell the difference, so I was worried somewhere in the corner of my heart... To be able to clearly see what you are doing, I admit it is a real hallelujah all-men ️ And the hero of the first episode of Glory!! I always think of ROMN as a brand that knows how to make buyers like it! Because it is a place that releases new products really quickly with various cute collaborations and packages, and various colors and textures, so it is a place to browse the purchase details page for nothing! sure
MDs are working hard! All-Young gathers only the items you want to buy ㅠㅠ If you buy anything with your eyes closed, is it acceptable?
Olive Young, the most popular cosmetics store! We always support you!
Oh hahaha really so pure!! I always believe in the Olive Young reviews and buy it. I subscribed.
The speed that Koreans really like ㅋㅋ He speaks moderately fast, so you have to pay attention! It's good to color your lips multiple times. The model's lips are so pretty ..️ I feel like this again that Romanne pulls out the real shades so well hehehe I'm going to go shopping for All Young soon!!!!!
Oh, and if the next review is Catrice Shadow!! I want to see you haha
I always go to see All Young once a month, and I am looking forward to seeing it being upgraded.
Olive young meets life tint rom&!
In the future, through the YouTube channel, interesting and useful

I hope to show you a lot of video content,

I will support you to become a YouTube channel of AllYoung TV that is loved and shared by many people!~
** Congrats on all-young's redecoration and launch! I look forward to many reviews for men! :)
It was a bit inconvenient to read reviews only with the All Young app, but it's nice to have a channel. Please upload more review videos in the future!!
The type of tint color is so pretty!! I want to use each type
Congrats on all-young's new makeover
Please give me a lot of good products in 2021
I already have rom and tint, but this video makes me want to buy it again!!! Thanks for the great video!
Wow... looking at the reviews, I think I should buy it right away ㅋㅋ Even a discount
Allyoung is the best!! Romanne .. it's so good .. I know Koduk's heart so very well
4:26
The color here seems to be the most similar to the actual color, but I really like it as a raw skin tint + a simple item. I found my personal color with this.
First of all, Olive Young's new look is really pretty and fresh, so it's nice to see.
Also, it is effective because you can pinpoint important information through the extract review collection.
We look forward to collaborating with various beauty YouTubers and reviewing more diverse beauty products in the future.
Above all, please be careful of Corona and lead a healthy and beautiful Korean beauty along with safe filming~
Seriously, these days, all young people are working hard ㅠㅠ I really like rom&n, with this event and even rom&video!!! I fall after rom and duck
It is so good before and after purchase because you can get the necessary information through reviewing reviews. Today, I am learning good tips.
This is the speed Koreans like. Editing is nice too.
What are you talking about rom and tint?! My mouth hurts just talking about it ! It really is such a perfect tint!! The video editing is so good, I watched it until the end hehehe
I really like Olive Young rom and tint~~ I'll keep using it all the time!!
Best suction power in an instant!
You did well.
Hey All-Young TV launch~~~~ The tint is so pretty ㅠㅠ It has a matte texture and it's moist, so it's ok even in the middle of winter
Praise for your hard work ♡♡Allyoung TV praises you for your hard work♡♡
As a student, I love Romanne.... Romanne will give out a lot of cool tones in the future....
Hey, the design is luxurious, the warm tone line is really pretty, and it doesn't stick to the mask well.

Dani I think I should put it in the honey item I really want to keep~!! Please review ROM&amp;n’s products often.
I first came across this with ROM&PACT, but this honest review of tint products from Olive Young is helpful in purchasing! Please support Olive Young's various activities :)
It's new content to review reviews hahaha I'll subscribe and watch it diligently
I love this shitty review....
even though it contains a lot of
It's a good review that catches my ears.( ˊ ᵕ ˋ )♡
All-young’s new look is definitely my style~~
Always a good product. Trust the product information
This is Olyoung seeing you
Let’s be together again this year ♡♡♡
You're working hard all year. Is it possible not to buy Rom'n like this? ~~~
Every time I go, I get excited about Olive Young.
 It is the most convenient to browse among the stores and there are so many pretty products
It was nice to show the color development delicately as it is the official Olive Young review channel! The rom&hanbok edition is really pretty. Next time, I'm going to see a review on the color development of the Espoir palettes ️️
It's a video of only the best ㅠㅠ It's so useful and helpful!!
I ripped off my planning!! Originally, I bought it while looking for reviews, but it is a great channel to save time and open your wallet by showing only steamed reviews like this.

++ Has anyone bought rom& only once?
Packaging is coming.... Pastel-toned dogs are pretty ️
Longevity is really no joke.. I didn't even ask for a mask.. I've only eaten dozens of lipsticks so far.. I'll have to get a Rom'n.. It's so pretty
It's so pretty ㅠㅠ
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha real Koreans like the speed... I just trust rom & tint ㅠ Actually, reviews are annoying, so I read one page, but it's really nice that you can tell me quickly with a video like this..
Rom'n is also a master of color tint ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I don't have a single color to throw away, everything is really pretty. As someone who really likes Rom'n's tint, I must try the hanbok edition!! The color is colorful, but the design of rom& is well chosen, so it makes me want to carry it with me all the time ️ And congratulations on the new makeover of Olive Young!! Hahaha I'm always looking forward to interesting video content.
The real video is noticeably hard!!! I really like the fact that it has only the important parts except for the useless ones. I usually like Rom'n, but the color is so pretty, it's perfect for me, and it kills the color TTTT The price is cheap, so I always buy it, but after watching the review videos, I want to buy another color.
Congratulations on the renovation of Olive Young~ I hope you will always prosper with good products~
I think the formulation of the tint is the most important thing, but it's a very satisfying content because you can easily choose it after watching this video ^^
All-Young again.....!!! Seeing this, rom & tint came to me~!!!! ㅠㅠ I'm so proud that the All-Young review I worked so hard for is being used in the video.
It's a hanbok edition!!!! The matte tint is really important for application, and I really like it ♡ I'll definitely have to get one
I do not really know that Rom and I do not know in Kodoku. I do not really know.
It's good to know good information. You can choose a good product more meticulously with the information provided by All Young, so you don't have to waste time and money anymore~~~~
It's nice to have a review organized like this.
You can see them separately according to the type of review, so you can see the necessary parts more easily.
I think the content is very good by reviewing the review!! When I buy from Allyoung, I tend to read reviews carefully, but there are a lot of articles to look for one by one, so I stopped reading. The only thing that was disappointing was that there was only a brief explanation for the content, but I felt better because I tried this content myself and did all the coloring! And it was good that you explained the disappointments>< I will review the All Young review and support the content!!
To be honest, I haven't tried Rom&Tint, so I can't say it's because of my nose ㅇㅇㅇㅇ Ji-Bora Yeong-I picked up the colors so well this time, so I bought it right away ㅠㅠ Rom&Jjang-jjang Olyoung who recognizes the real thing is great!
It's good to read reviews and refer to when buying
I didn't know there was an All-Young TV!! Every time a new product came out, it was fun to go to the store to test it out and bring a new child, but I was depressed because I wasn't good at All Young Shopping, which was the only way to relieve stress when going out because of Corona. !!! Even the fun of reading reviews on All Young TV and purchasing online and waiting for the delivery>< The chrome and color really came out prettier this time, so I came down with a short cut~
Hahaha the lip color is pretty ㅜㅜ I want to buy all of them after seeing the reviews.
Congratulations on the launch of "Review Review"!
The pros and cons of the beauty items you introduce are well known, so I can concentrate very well!
I always thought about Rom'n's, but I think they pick colors really well x 100 beautifully...
Besides, it's really amazing how you came up with the idea of ​​creating a hanbok feel for the cosmetic case as well.
Olive young has always been very well used. Haha
Please make a lot of good products.
As someone who uses Olive Young cosmetics, Olive Young is love.
The color is so pretty.
I think it would be pretty if I just carry it.
Even the color is so pretty ㅠㅠ It's crazy 🥺🥺🥺
I used only 7 rom & lip products.
I knew that Rom & Tinta was famous, but this is the first time I've seen a detailed review. I really appreciate Olive Young. Please show me various reviews of various makeup products in the future!
Subscribe Like Done
Haha I want them all!! It seems that the colors of the series that came out this time were pulled out well!! Haha It's nice to review with a video like this, Olyoung!! Please review other tints a lot!!
I think it's great to collect and organize Olive Young's best reviews!!!! The review, the voice, the speed, and the detailed explanation. I want to buy all of the products on here. Haeyong Olive Young Fighting
It's great to collect reviews and show them all like this.
Thanks to you, I got the information in a short time ^^
There are so many pretty colors while watching rom&n recently, I wanted to buy all of them, but I love this video so much.
It's fast, but it fits snugly in the ear and the color comparison by tint is so perfect.. Isn't the color of the room and tint too well subtracted!!
Just looking at the Olive Young reviews, it seems that my worries about buying cosmetics will be greatly reduced~ Admit!!!
Can a review be this fun?
This system is crazy lol
I love the color review and detailed color shots!!
It's a warm tone, but I bought it for Yeonji Bora. It's the prettiest color in the hanbok edition.
If you watch All Young TV, I think you can buy the most popular and pretty cosmetics at Olive Young these days! It's a video made only with honest reviews, so it's more reliable
See the extract for Beuduck? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I use rom&n often because the lip is really strong and the color is pretty ️ It's a good daily item.
Wow, there's no need to search for it, as you've given me all the things you're curious about.
One of the best reviews ever!!!
Oh my gosh, the Olive Young channel has been renewed and is back? Go crazy, I've always loved Olive Young, but I'm sure I'll be more interested in it in the future! You always do a lot of events and I feel happy inside with a positive influence • Thank you very much to the Olive Young teachers who give me a lot of inner friendship.
I don't think it's good because I didn't look for reviews :-) Because I show you the tips written in the reviews, so you know how it feels better haha
What's going on with the dictionary?! Fits snugly in the ear
The speed that Koreans just love is crazy....
Sister, are you hiding?
Sales are going well....
Congrats on Olive Young's new makeover ^.^ Hanbok Edition It's matte yet moist. It's perfect for me, who is rich in dead skin cells.. lol
ROMN catches trends faster than other brands and has great product power.
Oliz Young's new look is so cool
It was time to change the tint, but thanks to this review, I was able to change it to a good tint^^*
It was even more helpful to see the reviews I used, not the ads, and it was a great opportunity to know that there are better things out there than I was aware of!
thanks for the review
Rom'n is a product I really really like, but as soon as a new product is released, only reviews are collected and re-reviewed.
I sincerely praise All Young TV~~~
I really like rom&n that is really full and doesn't clump.
rom & case color zone
Ant Hell Olive Young....I'm going again today.
Looking at the photo reviews, it was difficult to choose because each lighting was different, but a detailed review with a video is very helpful~^^ I can clearly see the color difference!! The color is really good, I'm going to buy it
The review is so fast that it fits in my ears ️ I reviewed the color accurately so I think I will only look at Olive Young in future reviews!!
rom and tint is really the best ♡
I'm already using Room&'s products. As expected, I'm glad to see the first review on Olive Young.
From the rom & case to the color development, it's so pretty ㅠ The sense is the best until the opening date!!
I was curious about the rom and tint review, but it is so convenient to collect only the best reviews like this.
Thanks to you, rom and tint came out :)
The package is luxurious, Korean, and I like the color development.
I'm going all-young right now to buy Damju Beige!!!
Unlike other reviews, it shows quick and reliable information. I will buy it with reference.
I bought Yeonji Bora today!! Haha It's a really good item for cool tones...️ A color that is hard to find...
I'm going to take a good look at the Room and Tint review! I'm out of breath for the explanation hahaha
All-young's sense and ideas are really great to review reviews.
I saw Rom'n's hanbok edition for the first time, and the tint design is really luxurious and the color is absolutely insanely pretty. If the durability is good, this is all I have to say.
Watching the Olive Young YouTube channel saved me a lot of time organizing product reviews! With only 1,000 won, valuable and wisely. Even one minute is precious. Thank you for helping me spend smarter.
Thank you, subscribe, like, finished, and I have high expectations for the future, so I'm even setting an alarm~
After all, I can't live without All Young, the best, and All Young repeating new things!
A meticulous review will be of great help in a difficult time to test like these days!
Romanne I honestly didn't know, but thanks to the video I found out! It helped me a lot by letting me know how it was applied and the color characteristics!! It would be better if you could provide event information as well.
I can't use other companies' tints after coming into contact with the real Rom&Tint... As expected, my favorite Rom&Tint
It's great to know about the product through the review and to be able to make a wise purchase♡
I hate to ask because I wear a mask and I don't wear makeup well because I'm frustrated, but I want to see a makeup review using a simple and bright looking All Young product ^^
I really like the color development uwu~~ I really like it!!
I'm so glad you explained the reviews in detail 1!!
Wow, the video quality is crazy, and the rom & tint color is crazy.. It looks like you picked it up really well..! I was really thinking about whether to buy between the two, Ahn Geuk-Hwa, Coral, and Dam-Joo, Beige.. I just thank you for making this video ️️ Googoo Legend Event.. Really, if there is a lot of somersault and rubbing, I’ll give you a kiss ️ Oh, gosh! Thank you so much for making such a great video quality ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Rom and color ㅠ Run and buy it right now ㅠ
and! It's great that All Young TV has been refurbished. Review the review and the content of the corner is very good. The reviews on the Internet do not show the color development clearly, so it is not clear how much color is actually applied, how well it is applied, and how well it adheres. Praise!!!
More detailed usage videos and reviews for more various products, please! I support you~~
All young beauty YouTubers..? Isn't it really cool to pick out the best reviews? This feeling of being hollowed out.. It's so good to upload only the parts you need ~~ You are an All-Young who reviews even the things that you regret ..♡
I really like the room and really really ...
There are people who have never used it, but no one has ever used it hahaha The colors are so crazy ㅠㅠ
The place I always look for even if I buy one lotion or one wax
I hope there will be many developments in the future.
It's great to compare the pros and cons. I think Olive Young is the best.
Congrats on the new makeover of Olive Young~ Your new face is so pretty
Oh wow, it's only the best reviews out of the reviews.
In the past, I saw the color first rather than the review and bought it believing only my senses, but now I can't buy it without looking at the review ㅠㅠ In particular, Olive Young's steamed review design, color development, texture, formulation, and durability. ^ If you add a gradation in any part and mix it with a certain color, the color is fully expressed on the screen, so if it matches your skin color, get it without hesitation!!! There is no such thing as failure This review of Lima is also a great feeling.
I was looking for a safflower coral review and couldn't find it, so I ended up going around 5 olive young places to find it and color it myself ㅠㅠ
Such a lovely and kind Olive Young channel ㅜㅜ♡ As expected, I believe in Olive Young ~ ♡
It's a cool tone, but it's great that ROM&amp;n gave out a cool tone lip like this!! And I think it's great that All Young opened a YouTube channel like this, and Koreans love it so much!! Also, his voice was so loud that it came into my ears well!! In the future, I will have to listen to the news on AllYoung TV here haha
Every time I go to All Young, I always buy more than I expected, but this tint is so pretty it makes me want to buy it again.
Also Olive Young! Reviews are very helpful! I took a lot of captures while watching the video, I think I'll buy it right away hahaha Please upload a lot of videos
I really wanted to try the rom & hanbok edition, but seeing the review video makes me want to buy it!! I always release products according to all personal colors, so I think I will be able to choose the color that really suits me. It's a bit disappointing to have the courage, but considering the color development, durability, and mask staining, I'm really looking forward to it because it seems like it will be a satisfactory product after purchase!
I was really surprised to try Rom&N, but the matte tint doesn't stick to the mask, but if I use water tint it gets rid of the prejudice that it will stick to the mask well. I think all of these are really pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm going to go buy some shadows in the wall hehehe

The planning of this hanbok edition is too cool
Review the review! It is sometimes difficult to find all the reviews, but if you make a video like this, you can see the advantages and disadvantages at a glance, so it is good!! The credibility goes up even more by showing the actual product usage video.
It seems that there is really no one around who has never used rom and tint before,,,, there is a reason everyone uses it. I liked it so much that I settled on rom and tint ㅠ I only heard about the hanbok edition. I'm looking forward to All Young TV's heartfelt videos♡♡
Congrats on the new YouTube channel of Olive Young!!
The colors of the rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition are so pretty~
It's matte and moist, and the color development and lasting power are good, so I'd like to use it these days when I'm wearing a mask all day.
If you want to buy a product, you look for reviews in several places.
I bought it at Olive Young while thinking about it every day, but I like it because you explained it in great detail hehe I'm going to get a tint today.
It's so nice to be able to write the opening date. The color is also very well chosen this time-!! I'm going to buy it now.
If you do a more detailed and detailed review than a YouTuber, thank you very much.
It's comfortable and nice to see a collection of first-class tint reviews like this~!!!
Oh~~~ It's nice to gather reviews and talk about design features, color development, color durability, shortcomings, etc. in this way!! In particular, I am curious about the color of the lip and shadow, so I searched the internet repeatedly to choose a color. Nowadays, I live according to my personal color, but it's nice to have it all organized and talked about! In particular, talking together without omitting the shortcomings is not only talking about good things~♡ It hurts my eyes and bothers me when I scroll down the review, but when I turn it on like this, it will tell you everything, so I have to go see other reviews!! Personally, I'm curious about the scent reviews of diffusers, and I'm looking for them. I got an ad from kekk and found out that there is an All-Young channel and a video, and I'm very satisfied because it's very useful :D
I sincerely congratulate you on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review ^^
Thank you for introducing me to the very pretty tints in the video.. I think it will be very helpful for my future purchases ^^
I was curious about the color development of ROM&N, but it was very helpful to compare it with other products.
From the case to the recipe, the soft spreadability and the matte color are absolutely beautiful. Especially when I use a mask, my lips are completely erased, so I have to give up lipstick, but this product does not stick to the mask and does not erase, so I love it♡
Congratulations on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review!!!

"Olive Young Review" has a lot more reviews than any other famous review app!!!!
A love store that steps once a day! I look forward to "review reviews". pretty product
thank you ^^
The person who colored the lips, the corners of the lips are so pretty..
Rom'n's color development is really pretty~ This hanbok edition has a sense of courage~~!!
I only tell you the important parts and cut off the editing so I can understand it better. I want to give you a present! This hanbok edition ^^
It's great to see such a detailed and interesting review!! How is the review so fun hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I'm running to Olive Young today~~!
I'm always watching AllYoung TV ^^ I always support you~ Subscribe+Like done!
Wow, the reviews are really vivid. Now, I am looking forward to being able to check reviews of products I am curious about even if I only visit All Young YouTube.
The colors are vivid and I can see the details well, so I think it will be a great help in buying the right product for me♡
All-young's new look is so pretty~~ All-young means tint~~ I support you in communicating with consumers in various ways like this!! I love you Olyoung~^^
Wow, safflower coral is the color I was looking for....
I really love Rom&Tint, but I want to have all the colors of the hanbok edition.
It was a tint I originally wanted to buy, but after hearing the reviews and explanations, I think it has a lot of advantages, so my desire to buy it goes up. I really want to buy it!! I think the color would be perfect. I think it will be a life tint with no regrets. Thank you for the review and explanation!
The romen that you must have at least one Koduk!! Even the package is so pretty romen♡ The one without the pink color is really the prettiest!
Thank you for collecting all the reviews and making a video so that you can know the best tips. The review speed and voice are so pretty that you don't need to double speed!! I have to go buy it ️
ROM&N First of all, the design is very pretty. Traditional patterns are included, so you can enjoy the beauty of hanbok! I think I saved it, it’s pretty
It was also nice to put a sticker on the opening date! It's always hard to remove because it's stuck in advance, but it's good
You're doing a good job as an Olive Young YouTuber manager.
I like the video~~
Wow~~ This is Olive Young's new look, The Barry Goodgood.
It is so good and thank you for being able to see the new 'review review'.
After seeing the reviews that I have personally used, I will buy more with confidence!
 Wow.. the name of the corner is really smart by reviewing the review.
Why is the content so clear?
It was difficult to trust the review information on the screen such as color development and texture of the product because everyone was different.
 What makes this information even more reliable is the steamed reviews of many koduks who have actually purchased and used them.
It's full of great reviews of your favorite brands♡ Have fun watching it!
I love to see the review video!!
Please look forward to more reviews in the future.
The all-young review is the worst, but the rom&see-through matte tint is also very pretty ㅠㅠ The color is so good and the formula is well explained.
If you give it to me.. I'm running to Olive Young right now ️
Damju Beige is so pretty.. The model's lips are pretty, so I was mesmerized hehe The review was thorough and the speed was not slow, so it was useful! Congratulations on the renovation of AllYoung TV
It's so good it's so good it's good
If you buy after seeing the review master, you will be able to succeed without any obstacles in your decision!
I really like this corner.. I think the most unpredictable thing about the actual colors is the lip, but when the unexpected color comes, it's a pity and sometimes I don't like it ㅠㅠ But I think it will be helpful because I think you can get to know it well through this corner!! I personally like ROM&amp;n’s products, so I was more impressed.
Congratulations on the renovation of Olive Young. There are many new products, so I use them often.
The taste of the hanbok edition,,,, the color sense is great! What product description does Rom&N need? just the best!!
Congratulations on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review!!!^^

Review Master Lima's review and I really enjoyed the content!
Since the content is review content, it felt like content different from the existing content.
I like the tint ㅠㅠ Like Monga's rap, the video speed is fast, but the transmission is good.
Best review review
I heard about the release of the rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition.
As I haven't tested it yet, this review video was very helpful.
By selecting vivid reviews that show the color and spreadability,
As expected, the quality of the review was exceptional, but it was a review conducted by Allyoung. skrrrrt From the design to the color of the formulation, it was left in detail, so it felt like I had already experienced the product properly with a LAN cable~~~ There are a lot of tints colored in pink before riding, so I was always worried when I bought it, but I left it as a review. It's so convenient~~ Suction Cuck! I think it would be good to leave a review for Aviv Eoseongcho toner pad next time~~! I'll always look forward to you
The romman color is just crazy... and the hanbok edition??!! Even the package is perfect..♡
First of all, congratulations on the new YouTube channel of Olive Young.
The system to organize the best reviews seems really smart. Extract reviews that make you want to buy even if you don't really need it! I can't get out. hehe
Among All Young products, the products I am curious about are the Yuriage Zemos Toner and Yuriage Micellar Cleansing Water Sensitive. Since it is a brand I use often, I want to know more detailed information through the best reviews!
And there are all of them in each neighborhood, but there is no one in our neighborhood, so our Olyoung who orders online every day. I hope YouTube will be a hit and enter our neighborhood!
Editing and composition, Olive Young tv channel is so good Please upload a lot of good videos ♡
Olive young rom & see-through matte tint hanbok edition that stole my heart
Charming Olive Young rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition

Olive young rom & see-through matte tint hanbok edition is love

Olive young rom & see-through matte tint hanbok edition that is not wasted even if you give it all
Safflower coral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, I found my love,,,,, are you seriously crazy Romanne? It's a great love zone,,,,,,,,, thank you for the good review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's great to be able to check the exact colors and reviews before going to Olive Young! It saves time and at the same time you can quickly find the information you want.
All-Young YouTube Renovation is so good. The content you upload is also really good. I support you!
The speed and satisfaction of showing reviews are no joke.
After seeing a review like this, I won't be able to see any other reviews. There is a place that shows everything like this.
I heard for the first time today that All-Young TV exists hehe Besides, review reviews! It's a very fresh and new idea~^^ Honestly, I'm fed up with the cosmetics commercials there, but Olyoung's idea of ​​good ideas with unique characteristics is awesome♡♡ Planning genius Olyoung~ After all, cosmetics are Allyoung haha
It seems that Romn always works hard ㅠㅠ All of the products in the Hanbok edition are good, especially the tint doesn't show any dead skin cells. Oh, and I have a habit of biting my lips, so I have a lot of dead skin cells, so it applies very smoothly and goes well with the dead skin cells! I think it's great if you apply it in this situation o(TヘTo)
The design is too sophisticated to match the rom & hanbok edition, and the color is like a hanbok, so it’s so pretty.
Even the color development and durability are good, so there is no reason not to buy it!! Please upload more review videos to help with your purchase in the future. Fighting All Young TV
Congrats on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review
In a reality where it is difficult to distinguish the real from the fake in the information overflowing on the Internet.
It's really nice to be able to meet reliable reviews through AllYoung TV~
I want to spend 2021 together with All Young TV's rich content and Kichan communication!
I really like rom&n's honest honest review! all young tv fighting
Congratulations on your new look! I always use Olive Young and it's nice to be able to see the video and see more definite information!!!
I paid for this rom & hanbok edition because it was so pretty, but I feel like I have become a sensible person to appear on All Young TV like this.
The colors I use are light, so I usually apply dung beige, but it feels so good if I apply a purple rouge for a change of mood!
And the fact that there is no coloring is rather easy to clean, so I think it was a personal advantage!
If you use rom and tint once, you will only buy rom and tint again ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Congratulations on the new makeover of Olive Young! I enjoyed the tint review. Please listen to more reviews of good products in the future. I will cheer for Olive Young to receive a lot of love in 2021!~♡
No, your visual sense is no joke! After watching the video, I want to go all the time to buy tint!!!! It's nice to review
My Romanne, who has always been my favorite.. If it wasn't for All Young, would I have been able to meet you??? Thank you olyoung ㅜㅜ I love it
ROMN~~~ Work hard, work hard hey !! Is it too color? Yes,
I really like Rom&#39;&#x27;s color tones are pretty and they use a variety of colors.
The rom & color is really crazy.
The review is really heartwarming!
Thank you for always showing good information~!
I'm going to Olive Young right now and I'm really going to buy Rom'n's.. A tint pack that's perfect for mask conditions
I'm really looking forward to seeing real reviews rather than obvious reviews. I hope that the content will be loved and trusted by many people ^^
And I want to see a review of a foundation that suits your skin color ^^
Rom & Hanbok Edition, the color and design look really luxurious and pretty!
It's strange that you captured the feeling of hanbok, but I love it even more.
In addition to that, the price is not too burdensome, and even though it is a pretty lip, I am curious about the feeling of bare lips that do not stick to the mask!
I am already curious about the meticulous reviews and other reviews that focus well on reviewing reviews. I support Allyoung TV.
Olyoung, overflowing with meticulous and meticulous reviews, is love.
After seeing the review in the video, it's a little more certain and reliable! I look forward to using it often in the future.
I am really looking forward to the future because I think I will be able to meet reliable reviews quickly and in a fun way.
We will always be together :)
It's a fresh way to review a review haha ​​I come here often because Olive Young has a friendly feel to it!
Out of all the brands in the store, I like Rom'n the most, please tell me the lipstick details!
It can't be more perfect than this because I'm collecting reviews and doing a review, so if you buy it right away, you'll get a top rating bb
Olive young has a lot of good items, so I come to visit often.
I'll have to go look at that lip balm too!
It's really pretty because it sticks to Rom&'s lips and gives off a soft color. The full lip is pretty, and I think it'll go really well with the gradation! I thought it would be too nude, but the color is coral and I think the cool tone will be fine. Now all I have to do is leave a fun review on the AllYoung app. I'd be grateful if you could also incorporate my review into the video later ㅜㅜ
It's great that All Young reviews
All-Young's new look is so pretty and pops out. All-Young!! The hanbok edition is really good. I will always support you in the future~!!
This is a video that shows off the charm of ROM&SEERU matte tint. I enjoyed it ^^
As the first tint, the color development is very pretty. I am always curious about the color development of tints and it is important. Thank you for the detailed review~
Congrats on the new look at Olive Young.
I think the rom & see-through matte tint color development is really good. In particular, I am more confident in introducing only the steamed reviews of Olive Young!

I'm really looking forward to the review master, who will collect and inform you of only the steamed reviews of Olive Young in the future.
at Olive Young

I enjoyed the video of the extract collection, which was compiled by collecting only the best reviews.
Congratulations on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review. :)
In the new year, we look forward to and support you with more diverse content from AllYoung TV. ^^
It is very useful to select and show reviews.
Other beauty YouTubers went into too many filters and couldn't find them properly.
It's really nice that it shows the texture and color in a realistic way.
I support Olive Young's YouTube channel. I'll continue to subscribe and watch!!
The rom & color is so pretty!! The collaboration is good and the composition is great!!
Awesome ㅠㅠ!! What is All Young ️️️ Until the event?!?!?!? I will participate in Yvonne timidly hehe Please make a lot of good videos in the future!!
The review video is short, quick, and concise, but the content is clear and I love it!! If it's long, you won't be able to see it well.
In All Young, you can compare various products and compare the color development, and it was nice to be able to buy it with a lower price if you use it when the halku is paid!!
[Review the review] This content is great
Olive Young's new makeup update~ Olyoung's face is so pretty♡♡♡ Actually, I look for a lot of reviews on the Olive Young app. A lip product that doesn't stick to the Lee Si-guk mask is a real sweetheart. No matter how pretty the color is, if it gets on the mask, I can't get my hands on it anyway ^^; From the review of this video, I found that the design, formulation durability, and good color combination when used by mixing, and that it is an indispensable disappointment.
The fact that even the dots appear on the courage is something I sympathize with, so you have to be careful when writing it.
Olive Young's YouTube review is really the best rom & see-through matte tint with hanbok edition that can save the beauty of Korea is really cost-effective and has the best design application, etc. Are there people who don't know yet?! For those of you who say that you can't use the matte lip because it gets caught in the lip wrinkles, try Yoai! You will feel that the pinching is definitely not noticeable compared to other products ^^ The price is cheap and the colors are diverse, so you can buy several and add more colors to create an attractive color~ Please make a lot of various steamed reviews of Olive Young so that more people can see it~^^
Olive Young YouTube channel, congratulations on the new renovation! ️ It was a pity that I couldn't test the product at the offline store like before because of Corona, but I can experience it on YouTube like this~! It's just a pity that I didn't know about Olive Young's YouTube channel.. I'll come to visit often in the future Olive Young YouTube~~
Not only is the rom and tint pretty, but it's good that All Young reviews it like this haha ​​It's useful for a single person who only goes to the store and worries every day.
I sincerely congratulate AllYoung TV on the new makeover, and I enjoyed the rom and tint review!

Allyoung TV gave me a fun and exciting review, so I was immersed in it ^^ As expected, the video review is great!
All-Young's new look is so pretty and new!!!
When it comes to tinting, after all, rom&! Excellent color development and adherence to lips
best!!!
The tint color is so classy and pretty!! I'm still running out of tint, but I'll have to go to the store to buy it this afternoon.
Congrats on the renovation of Olive Young. It's great to buy after seeing reviews ^^ I'm really liking the pretty items ~ Cheer on #AllYoung!
Even if I buy one, I buy it while comparing all the reviews, but this video solves everything! comfort
Thank you Allyoung. I picked out only the points and showed them, and based on the reviews I've personally used, I'm more confident! Also...
I look forward to more in the future as it has been beautifully renovated!!
It takes a few days just to worry like me, but I think the Olive Young YouTube review is very helpful.
We support
It is the cleanest and fastest among cosmetic reviews, so there is no feeling of frustration. It seems like it will be a lot of reference!
Wow hahaha But it's a really final review.
1. Each color can be viewed in detail with the wrist lip color video
2. Pick a personal color that suits you, so you can decide easily
3. Description based on the advantages felt by actual buyers
Congratulations to Olive Young. I hear it often because I can feel free to go into the store and experience the product. Hehe The tint in the hanbok edition is so pretty. ~♡♡
More focused and immersed than the home shopping broadcast! Writing a review Rather than looking for a review article, one review video like this will have a huge advertising effect!
It wasn't available at the Honghwa Coral offline store ㅠㅠ It's only available in the online mall.. I went all the way to receive Honghwa Coral in real life, but it was a pity that it wasn't there ㅠㅠ
The more I listen, the better the reviews seem. The voice and video remain so well in my memory.
There's a rom&color matte tint!! It is so fantastic. The color development is all well done, it's great.
#AllYoungTV commend the new look. I will always support you.
I trust Gaeko, and I use ROMN often, but if I push it like this again in All Young, I will have to be a jerk.
It was nice to be able to look at this more objectively by picking up on this disappointing point!
By the way, I really like the 6:24 ppt design... lol
Your lips are pretty ♡♡
The more you look at the reviews, the more you must buy rom and tint!! >0<)/
The case with a softly shining Korean beauty is pretty, and the sticker to remember the opening date is also sensible!
The color covering all warm tones and cool tones is good, and it does not smear on the mask and lasts for a long time.
It looks great! If it's been a long time since you put on makeup to wear a mask and you take it off
Wow, thank you so much for the review collection. It's the first time I've watched a cosmetic review video to the end. Haha I've been using only tint for a few years because I'm a lip-eating style, so I'm very interested in tints. The tints also vary in color, and it is difficult to find reviews because you have to check the durability, brightness, and keratin level, but this is perfect for All Young! I am more than moved and admired that only the best reviews were made into a video like this ㅠㅠ Really, AllYoung's recommended products have never failed ️ Our love #OliveYoung Let's be together forever ️
Thank you for uploading a good teen review video in winter when I am already very worried about dry lips and chapped lips.
rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition is so attractive. The color and color development are the style I want! Thank you for reviewing a good product. All-Young TV prosper!
Lima, good job!!! I wanted to buy it because the design was so pretty, but it was so annoying to find it, so it was good information for me, who was putting it off.
Wow, to review a review.. Did my heart, who is bothered to read reviews rather than looking for them myself, have reached that point..? This video was completely recruited at once. The color is crazy, the matte texture that doesn't come off on the Lee Si-guk mask, and even the hanbok package is a godsend!! Yeonji Bora is completely drunk ㅠㅠ!! I always looked at the expiration date and said only a few months after opening. No reason not to live I'm going to run all the way tomorrow
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I bought rom and tint like a bewitched while watching my friend color it hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha;)
When you need any cosmetics, All Young struggles!! Please do a lot of the best events of the year haha
I was curious about rom & tint, but even a quick new review~~~ It's nice to compare all the pros and cons.
I really like rom & lip products, but the shape, color, and even the package design are absolutely crazy ㅋㅋ I'm running!
I got a lot of All-Young gifticons after the entrance exam, so I was worried about what to buy, but I think it would be very convenient to buy it after watching the video!! It's cumbersome to look everywhere, but I think it's good to be able to solve it all at once. I'm going to buy Damju Beige for Spring Warm Tone~~
Rom & Tint is famous, so I was very worried about whether to buy it or not, but after seeing the video, I was suddenly sold.
I really like Olive Young, as there are more brands every day. I bought it at a discount this time from rom&and I really like it!!! Zero lip is also really recommended! I love the color of Anby Me!~!~!!~!!
It's really nice to be able to know the details of the product in detail and quickly~ I think if you gift it to your girlfriend in the video, she will like it hahahaha I enjoyed the video!!
After reviewing reviews and being introduced to tint products through videos, it helped me a lot in purchasing. It's good that consumers can judge objectively, and it's good to introduce good products...
Allyoung is also good at YouTube... I've known this series is pretty, but after watching the video, my desire to buy is welling up.
When I say Olive Young goes in, I think I always buy something and come out hahaha I really like Rom'n's products too~
••• rom and tint that is easy to hear !!!!! Me too, the smudging wave rouge purple color is prettier than the full mouth.
Various colors, sophistication and neatness. Anyone can become an artist with just a tint case. It is a highly anticipated product with charisma that adds charm to makeup technique.
I go here so so too often!
Not only for women, but also for men
There are so many essential products.
It's good to get discounts often. Above all, the staff
I still wanted to buy a tint, but because it was just introduced in this video, my eyes are going down.
I'm going to go to Olive Young right now to test it out and buy it.
Wow, I think this content is very good... It shows each product feature one by one and also collects reviews to show you, so it feels like you are being sold and at the same time you decide whether to buy it or not...? Less time to decide. I was still thinking about this, but after seeing this, I finally bought a tint... lol
By the way, I think Romn is a brand that Koduk has no choice but to love... The product itself is good, the cost performance is good, and it seems to understand consumer needs well. A brand you can't help but love...
So far, when I look at products with cool tones, there are many cases of lukewarm or warm tones, but this rom & product, especially Rouge Purple, has a really pretty purple color, so I'm very satisfied because it seems like a color that cool tones can use well :)
+) The voice of the voice in the video on All Young TV was well explained so I watched it without fast-forwarding haha
I like it because it is easier to see the reviews in a video than to find and read them individually! hehe
Especially for your first review on lip products.
I don't like lip products, so I use this and that, but these days I haven't been using it at all because of the mask ㅠㅠ Seeing this review video makes me want to buy it.
The newly renovated store is also clean! I love it so much when I buy something I need or give it as a gift, I think I'll be looking for it often! Product reviews are very useful and nice
Lots of useful information.
The color is beautiful and the case is neat.
Before I stop by Olive Young every day, I always check the official website for reviews and sale items. My own one-pick! Subscribe, like! Review~ I support you!!^^
Olive young review you can trust~ Be sure to check it when buying a product
Olive young has a lot of reviews, so it's helpful for purchase, but they're core reviews ㅠㅠ It's great to review reviews.
I saw a lot of them last year while working part-time at Olive Young (especially All Alain Guide), but I came here today because [Review Review] was newly launched on KakaoTalk!
The number of visitors to Olive Young is very high. I also worked part-time at Olive Young, and since the Olive Young store in front of my house is my carrot market trading meeting place, I think I go there almost every day. So, visiting every day, "All Alain" and
I look for products recommended in "Olive" and try them out to find and purchase good products that are right for me. I tend to buy most of the products I use, from basic products to makeup products at Olive Young.
I think it will be a very helpful channel these days, as people are more interested in cosmetics. Please review a lot of products in the future.
I think the color development of rom and tint is really good. Besides, the fact that it doesn't smear on the mask is even more eye-catching. Guess I'll have to go to Olive Young to get some good stuff~
I will always support All Young TV.
Congratulations on the opening of All Young TV! It's better because you can check details that cannot be confirmed with a photo review only with a video review~ Fighting All Young TV'
I put tint on the mask, so I was looking for a tint that didn't stick, but I found it here! I've got a reason to go all-young.
The color is pretty, but isn't the name too pretty?
It's so nice to review reviews. It's not a short time, but once you see it, you can't stop.
Lastly, I envy the model's lips...ㅜㅜ
After all, Olive Young has the strongest color items!
All information about ROM& see-through matte tint is contained in this video.
It's great that you can only find the reviews you need at super speed without having to look for them ^^
From the rom & package, it is very lovely and luxurious :)
It can be applied with a full lip or gradation, and the mask does not stick and it is matte, but I love it because it does not show dead skin cells on the lips! I didn't buy lip because it's Lee Si-guk, but seeing the video, it's a good buy!!! Everything is pretty, but I think it would look good when I applied 08 Safflower Coral, so I think it would look good on a daily basis.
As expected, thanks to All Young Sense bb, I'm craving for this and that, so I'm going to go shopping on the Olive Young app!!!! Thank you for always working hard.
All-Young YouTul, which uploads only the necessary information. Fighting!
When I buy All Young products, I look at the reviews, and especially when I buy lip products, bloggers make sure to look at all color reviews.
The video speed and delivery are also great. Please upload more videos in the future.
Wow, it's so cool to see the change in All Young. Participated in the event
I'm going to Olive Young to buy room and tint haha ​​But after watching this review video, I found the color that is my style♡ Thank you for the detailed and honest review Olive Young you can trust and use
The rom & colors are so beautifully chosen... I'm so proud of you!!!
Rom'n always looks so pretty in color ㅠㅠ I want to buy it
For tints, color development is more important than anything else, but I think the rom & color development power is really good.
We hope that All Young TV will be loved more with various reviews in the future.
Review the review and the content is so good!! It's become an era where you can't even believe reviews.
It's amazing who's idea you are reviewing reviews!
You can buy Olive Young products with more confidence. I always support you!!
Wow, I really liked the original Rom & Tint, but this new one is still the same!! Originally, I thought it would be nice to have a matte texture than the velvet tint, but the meticulousness considering the texture as well as the color of the case is revealed. ..? Hehe I guess it's because the color of the case was chosen too well. The color is really a soft pearly color that goes well with the hanbok. It's elegant and old-fashioned. The review is not too slow, but the point is well captured. Haha Not only did he tell me how to use it in collaboration, but there was even a test scene that made me want to buy another product. I'm preparing to go to Olive Young right now.
In the meantime, I didn't know what to buy, but I think you can buy it after watching the review master video to introduce it neatly. Congrats on your new look
I've been watching All Young TV since the All Alain Guide, and I'm proud that I'm growing up. Is this kind of a parent's heart? Lima, I love how you quickly explain rom & hanbok tint. Even the shortcomings at the end can be felt!! I look forward to it in the future
It's special to review a review again~
I was hesitant to purchase after only reading the reviews, but it's the kindness that confirms this~
It's possible because it's Olive Young, right?
I hope and support you that you can meet fruitful and useful content through YouTube.
The color of All Young's new makeup is pretty and trendy. That's why people seem to be all year long ^^
Wow Rom'n!
From the case to the color, it's so pretty
A must-have item!
Congratulations to AllYoung TV.
Room and tint hanbok edition is a sniper to my taste.
After looking at the written review, I saw the review on the AllYoung TV video, and the color and spreadability seemed to show better, so I want to buy it!!
Subscribed and liked!!
Oh... Thank you for the sincere review video hahaha
Like the hanbok edition, the lip package is so pretty.
I really like the texture, color, and color development!
I was looking for a lip that doesn't ask for a mask these days...
The safflower coral color is really pretty.
Long lasting and good color
A pompu that I want to purchase is coming.
I'm going to Olive Young tomorrow.
All Young TV's old content and videos were professional and good because they had the informational feel of a makeup program that was aired on TV, but the recent videos have an Instagrammable or Facebook humor feel, so it's easy to see and fun. I support you!!! In particular, this content was great because it was an opportunity to quickly learn about new products for me, who loves rom&. I want to run and buy Honghwa Coral right away.
I got to know Rom'n through Olive Young, and I really liked it! I'm so glad you gave the review so detailed!
There are not one or two products that I really like the color of.
I've never tried Rom'n, but I watched this video
Pompoo has arrived! I'm going to have to make it this time.
I really hate stuff like this because it's frustrating, but I really like this kind of video ㅠㅠ It only tells the core and the speed isn't frustrating, but it's not too fast, and even the dictation is perfect,,,
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa onlydllyyyyyyy--Can I go and live here now? Or in the online store...?
I first learned about rom & tint after watching Allyoung TV on YouTube. The design is good and the color development is so pretty ㅠㅠ I will definitely buy it.
The color is so pretty. I want to apply it freshly this spring. It's good that it doesn't stick to the mask♡
I was shocked once with the package and again with the color of the contents. Isn't it so pretty?!!!️It makes me want to run Olive Young right now ㅠㅠ
I always read reviews before buying a product.
Only important reviews are summarized and mentioned in the video.
It is so useful and keeps stimulating the desire to consume..!
I need to go and buy a rom and tint ㅠ
Congrats on the new manager. I'm always cheering you on
Olyoung is the best
Wow, the color is so pretty. I definitely want to buy it and give it as a gift!!

The color of rom and tint is really pretty
I came across this by chance after reviewing a review, and I think it's really content that I can't help but love.
When I buy cosmetics, I always read reviews before buying, but I have to read reviews of colors I like, but don't you get angry if there are only reviews of other colors..? (Is it just me? haha)
And if you look at the reviews, there are a lot of advertisement reviews, but when you review the reviews, you actually use them, collect the consumer's feelings, color development, and even review.
I really enjoyed watching the video reviewing reviews on the Olive Young Steamed Review official channel, which has a lot of reviews! It's only the best reviews, so I think it's more reliable
I want to buy it again..! I'm using it, but the design and color development are both good.
Only the best reviews are collected, so it's great when choosing a product!
All-Young TV is a subscription-based service ️️ The voice of the older sister who reviews me is stuck in my ears and the speed is too articulate
Olive Young has many stores and has a variety of products, so I like it :)
It was hard to find a tint that was right for me, but I accidentally tried rom and tint and settled on it.
I am so happy that everyone who sees it says that the tint color is perfect.
After all, Rommen does not disappoint!! I love all rom n lip products.
I'm going to have to buy the products in this video too :)
If there is a product that I want to buy at All Young, I always buy it after seeing a review in the app.
Okay, Im Gujoong
ROM&amp;n design, color development... ㅠ
I really recommend it when you wear a mask~
If I had bought this much Rom'n, I'd have collected as much as the owner of Rom'n ㅠㅠ But Olyoung is making me go crazy again. Take my bankbook.
\(~□~)/
I did something called the hanbok edition, but from the product design to the color, it is subtle yet luxurious! Apart from hanbok, I change the way I express myself according to the mood and atmosphere of each day in my daily life!
Wow, it's really great to review all-young TV's new content review.
I usually get information through YouTuber's recommended reviews, but since so many different YouTubers have different thoughts, it's hard to organize the content and watch all the videos every day, but I think it's great that the official Olive Young channel recommends this! And when I watch other YouTuber videos, to find the content I want, I watched it at 2x speed so that I can watch it quickly. It really only organizes what people want, so I think we will continue to take care of it in the future! jackpot jackpot
Mae-jik that you watch until the end after doing something..
All-Young feels like you’re young when you go in and go out haha
A place to come out imagining being young and beautiful
Every time I go, I feel excited and excited ^^
The longevity is the most disappointing part, but because of the detailed explanation in the video, I think I will choose it without much thought when choosing a tint!
I saw this video and liked it, so I ordered Safflower Coral and Yeonjibo.
I like the gel among the tints ㅠㅠㅠㅠ This is my first time doing a matte tint.
this tint

Please use it only once ㅜㅜㅜㅜTT The safflower coral color is really pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
The video that cannot be skipped because of the speed, voice, and dictation content is perfect...!!! I haven't tried rom ent tint, but it makes me want to try it...!!!! I'm not using tint often because of Corona these days, but I'll have to get one soon and wait for the day to come when I can take off my mask and apply it to my heart's content!!
I really like the rom & glasting water tint!
Moisturizing, less smearing and long lasting
It's a pity that I missed the special price ㅠㅠ The tint color looks good and I just summarized it, so I'll get a lot of information from the All Young channel when I buy products in the future.
Congratulations on the launch of AllYoung TV & "Review Review"!!

In these busy times, a smart guy who collects only the best reviews and introduces them!!!
Will you continue to post useful review content in the future?!
I hope that many people will be loved, and I will give you my love too!!
Wow, thanks again for checking other people's reviews! Do you like me?
I can't put on stuffy lips, but somehow it seems to suit me well!!
Please review reviews in the future!! I think I'll wait
And the review I want is a moisturizing basic product. Be sure to review steamed moisturizing products that are essential from the age of 30. ( •͈ᴗ-)ᓂ-❥
Moderately fast speed.. Straight vocals.. Reviews are neat.. I wasn't very interested in rom & tint, but thanks to you, my desire to buy is increasing.
rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition is attractive. Also, it is very helpful to unravel this charm with a review. I support All Young TV!! Thank you for communicating frequently through YouTube and sharing a lot of good news and information. We hope that you will share good news and content in the future and receive a lot of love. I hope to receive a lot of interest and love from many people.
As for the color, Rom&,,, all products are pretty ㅜㅜ The hanbok edition also has different colors haha ​​It's so pretty! I didn't know there was an All Young YouTube channel, but I subscribed right away!
I think Rom'n is really great. The color is no joke, it's so pretty
All-Young TV reviews reviews! I really liked the color and formulation of rom&n, so I was still buying it.
Oh, All Young TV is so good!
Originally, I watched it while skipping 10 seconds at a time, but I watched it all at a smooth pace...
wow
This tint is attractive♡
The color is good and the color is pretty.
There is hardly any
I really like being able to compare men's cosmetics, apply samples, and purchase them at All Young. The store is clean and the staff is friendly!
This is rom and tint that I trust and use!! I am satisfied with the color development, application, and durability!
Olive young getting better than now is amazing
I'm really satisfied with the new look. The rom & tint sticks well and I love the color!
Hanbok Edition is really good marketing!
All-Young's new look is so good!! The speed is also very customizable so it's nice.
Also, Olive Young always works hard.
I recently found out that this is a review restaurant, and I really like the idea of ​​reviewing reviews.
Subscribe and go!
Oh, there are many reviews, so you can buy olive young with confidence.
The news of the new makeover, I'm so looking forward to it and I'm so happy @_@
The one and only beauty channel!!! Will you be with me this year too??
Please recommend some hot beauty items.
The case was as pretty as a hanbok color....! The color inside is really pretty.
Even though there are a lot of reviews, there are so many ads these days, so it's hard to tell which one is the real one. what is the point There are cases where the reviews are contradictory, so there are many times when I don't know which one is right, but you can point out the points by reviewing the reviews, so it's easy to understand even for people who don't know much about makeup ^^ Please introduce more good products in the future! 2021 cheers
This is a really fun review~ ㅋ Please do a concealer review like this~ I'm having a hard time deciding which one to buy, but if you review a good product, I'll be able to choose a good one~ ^^
Hull Rom&#39;s new line case is also pretty, but I love the color and there is nothing missing,,
Olive's new look is so good! I really liked the good review~
All-Young TV Every content uploaded is a hit. I look forward to good content events in the future. I support you!
>>Review the review<< Who wrote the ingenious content!! It's really good because it's helpful and sympathetic hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha” according to Allyoung TV, which has captured all of the speed, content, and comments, and likes it? do it right away..
Congratulations on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review! I think it's a very welcome idea to review a review. It was difficult to read all the reviews and it seemed meaningless to only see one or two, but now I can find All Young TV.

To be honest, I didn't know much about Rom'n, but after watching the first episode, the desire to purchase is rising. ㅠㅠ I'm very curious about the fact that it hardly sticks and the durability is good. The sticker that can mark the opening date is also very nice. I think it makes a more vivid review by showing a video that can't be shown with photos alone.
Among the reviews, King Review is reliable and explains well, so I can live without worrying. I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend on Valentine's Day, so I'm pretty and I'm grateful for my girlfriend's appearance +100.
I was curious about rom and tint, but this review from Olive Young cleared my doubts and it's so good
I'll have to visit Olive Young tomorrow and try it right away.
The design of the rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition is so pretty~ I think it would look so pretty when applied with a gradient. It's so good to write these days that it doesn't come off.^^
The color is really good
Damju Beige is the product I really want to get this time.
I really like matte tint, especially rom and tint.
Matte sticks well, but there is no flaky skin
Thanks to the best reviewers out of the Olive Young reviews, I was able to easily find out about the products I didn't know, so I had a very easy purchase experience! I use olive young often!!
The mask had too much lip on it, so I was going to change it this time.
I saw the review in the video and it came out so well I can trust it.
All-Young TV review review is really the best~!
The voice and video are good so you can concentrate without sagging.
He explains everything you may be curious about about the product without missing out on anything, and is kind to the points that you regret. This is a really great video
Rom&Tint was developed from scratch.
I wanted to buy Jahwang Red, but thank you for the clean and succinct review ㅜㅜ Allyoung seems to be working very hard these days. I'm going tomorrow and I'm going to buy it, thank you
I am a person who reads reviews thoroughly.
There are times when I am frustrated because it takes a long time to read, but it is so nice to pick out a few and introduce them.
This content was just what I needed!
I'll take a look at the upcoming video-
The colors are all pretty, and I personally think the gloss is great. I'm running.
The olive young tint is really crazy ㅠㅠ
Congratulations on the new makeover of Olive Young :) The color of the rom and tint is good and I really want to buy the hanbok edition
This is a review video that makes you buy all 4 of them, not anything out of them
All Young YouTube subscription complete!
I came here to know about scalp and hair care.
This is a restaurant that reviews makeup and basic care products.
Come and share your experiences with the products you are curious about.
This is Merseon 129~
It's so easy to summarize the All Young review~
But the color is different.. Pompu..
After all, reviews are life when buying cosmetics..! I watched the video and installed the app right away.. Haha I thought it was just a new brand? But after seeing the reviews, I changed my mind. I'll try it.
Olive Young has a variety of products,
It seems to be a store that does not feel burdensome even if a man enters alone!
The staff at each store you go to are also very friendly, making it a pleasant shopping experience.
This is a store that goes well all year round, but the information on the reviews is very good~~
I came here to see the video and it's sold out haha
I'm not really interested in lip these days because I wear a mask, but what is it.. Colors ㅠㅠ Damju beige, Yeonji-bora ㅠㅠ It's so pretty
And another thing I like is that there is a sticker to manage the opening date! Personally, I put the gyeonchul paper one by one, and it's perfect.
As many people like All Young, there are many reviews, so I am a review lover.
Purchase the product at All Young! All Young TV before purchasing the product
It is very helpful because you can see detailed product descriptions and vivid reviews at once. Please continue to increase the number of subscribers and upload a lot of good videos.
I wanted to buy a tint, but I have to refer to it. Please review more products in the future.
All-young's new look is neat and nice ^^
It's a good product for color development and retention of rom & tint ^^
I think it's really good for daily makeup or point lip with all the colors in it~
Thank you so much for always a good product ^^
It is beautiful even when used as a tint, and the color is soft even when used as a blush. I was looking for a tint that felt like it was not applied and I urgently need to go buy it!! I'm happy with the video speed! good~
Congratulations to Olive Young.
The color of the hanbok edition is good, the design is pretty, and the color restaurant is so pretty.
Shopping Cart: Rom&Safflower Coral / The price is also good . Thank you for the review
The all-young TV manager has become very stylish!! I always use it all the time. Rom&review is very thorough and useful hehe I'm going to buy it sooner or later.
I've been using rom & tint well, but this one's color and design are all so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'll have to try this one next time!
The concept of reviewing reviews is fresh and good
The speed that Koreans like hahahaha
I think Rom&n is really good at picking colors.
It's a hanbok edition!! For some reason, the color is really pretty hehe It spreads well and is so pretty ㅠㅠ It's a product I use frequently from Rom'n, but I'm using All Young right now.
The detailed review helped me a lot with my purchase!!
It's like reviewing a review haha ​​I wonder if my review will come out someday hehe It's true that there's no such thing as the same color under the same sky hahaha
right! It's a quality content review with texture and speed that I like, so I watched it carefully from start to finish, and expressed my gratitude with Like Kuuk instead!
[Rom and see-through matte tint hanbok edition] I knew enough to appear several times in group chats with friends, but it is detailed and detailed! consumer and purchase
voluntary
Reviewer Lima, please let me know what you want to know from your point of view.
In particular, I reported the 2:04 part and shared the video with my group chat room friends, but I feel a sense of pleasure in the clean mask that doesn't ask anything!
I almost bought the rom & hanbok edition, but after seeing the reviews, it looks like I'll have to buy it again and stock up.
I really like the launch by reviewing the reviews of All Young! Rom'n is my favorite brand~ Beautiful design and various colors! The review video made me want to buy the tint.
Rom&Tint is also love~ The hanbok edition is so pretty! I love the color and the color development is amazing! Thanks for the good review.
Be an All-Young TV with active communication and good content. We will always support you.
I'm using tint and the color is almost accurate! Now, before I go to All Young, I have to watch the All Young TV review.
Olive Young! There are not many tints, but the color is really good!!!! I couldn't put on the matte because of the dead skin cells in the winter....I see it in the video and it looks great! I'm going to run over the weekend.
I've only used rom & tint coral products, but I want to try a matte version with a cool pink color product or a deep red color product!! The hottest rom & tint these days haha ​​Thank you for this honey review information!! I love it for reference >_<️ I'm going to go get it soon!!! (Look forward)
rom&hanbok edition, looks like pretty products from design!!
I was curious about this product, but after seeing the video, I really want to try it.
There is also a discount, so if you want to buy it, you have to buy it soon!
It is a product I have always wanted to try, so I am looking forward to it.
I wear a mask every day because of Corona these days, so I only used lip balm, but after seeing the video, I want to apply Rom'n.
Reviews can be so fast and fun!! Olive Young is always full of ideas~ I praise you~
Please review Dr.G's Black Snail Line~~I've tried the cream, but I can't try anything else, so I'm curious~Ampoule, eye cream, mask pack? give!!
The voice is easy to hear and I did not press the right tab even once while watching this video hahaha
After personal color, I only look for products related to cool tones, but whenever I search for it, I always see Romn-!! So naturally, I found out that Romn takes good care of cool tones-!! I already bought a lot of rom& products through Olive Young-Tong! It's new, so I'll have to pick it up again-!! Long live Olive Young!!
Please keep Olive Young for hundreds of years from now, where you can shop for cosmetics and various daily necessities of various brands at once. We also support the newly renovated Olive Young!!!
Huh great great!! Yesterday I read the review of the rom&tint hanbok edition and thought a lot about whether to buy it or not, but after reviewing the review I was convinced hehehe I will buy it!! For me, who couldn't decide just by looking at the review photos, the All Young video showed the correct color development!! Even better!! I want to buy something, but if you're not sure, I'll have to watch the AllYoung video hehe Thank you AllYoung TV
In the rom, the tint color is so pretty and the texture looks so good ㅠㅠ I want to buy it ㅠㅠ
I think it would be nice if you could review each perfume type!
I was sad that the All-Alain Guide was over, but to say that this is a review of Moram... Olyoung who understood all my needs..I love you..☆♡
It's quirky to collect reviews and review them! It was difficult to see so many reviews at once.
I want to go to the store and buy it as soon as possible because Allyoung will organize it. Please upload a lot of various contents in the future.
I'm sucked into the fast-paced Horororok! I think it's good that you can get more tips by reviewing the review again.
Hell, I'm still wearing a see-through mat lol.
People with warm tones buy anything other than Damju Beige..?
ROM&N is the only item that I believe in without having to apply color in All Young because it has a really good value for money and the color is guaranteed hahaha
best best
Seeing the detailed review of rom & tint makes me want to buy it ^^ I can only see the best reviews of All Young products, so it's great as an All Young fanatic.
Subscribe, Like Done
Comments I usually know it well, but it gives me the necessary information clearly and clearly, so it's good to refer to when buying.
It's so much fun to review reviews.
I'll watch it often~ I've even finished setting up subscription and like notifications ♡
I recommend this tint that deserves the first place.
I don't like watching reviews on video.. It's nice to see it because it's almost accurate and speaks quickly. It's full of information..
It was difficult to choose because there were so many kinds in the offline store, but I am really glad to meet you on YouTube. We hope that it will be a happy space, and become an all-young channel that is always loved!
Still, I was looking for a new lip because it's a lip balm these days!! I was still coveting the hanbok edition!! You're posting a review like this, so reviewing a telepathic moyamoya review is dignified and new, and it's great because it's all-young's own content. Please collect and upload more reviews in the future~~!!
Olive Young!! I love it so much haha
The new look is so pretty~~!!
We support!
All young who is pretty and fun to watch ️
A ray of hope for cool tones, Rom&! The color is really pretty and the application is moderately matte, but it doesn't show off the dead skin, so I really like it! The tint name is only in English in other places, but this line is even better with Korean words!
A special price that makes your eyes sparkle before going to work!! A gift like this before Lunar New Year's Day and Valentine's...
[Review All Young TV review] The content is very helpful. I gave it as a gift to my girlfriend because she liked the 'Rom&' product, but the reviews here are also good♡♡ I love the trendy content of rom&n more prosperous and All-Young TV~

08 Safflower Coral (Memo)
Ah...Rommen! By the way, I think the idea of ​​reviewing reviews with Lima's drip and sensibility is really good.. It's my taste☆ Be modest with me in this corner :D
The color of the rom & see-through matte tint hanbok edition is so pretty~!
Subscribe like!
Rom&H & Hanbok collaboration is the best! How did you come up with this design? It's really cool!!
All 4 colors are pretty, but my favorite is Damju Beige... I think I'm going crazy. It's so pretty ㅠㅠ I'll definitely buy it!!!
Review the review!
This is absolutely honey information. Anyone with a decision disability who is worried about the color must watch it! Especially thanks to the sweet idea of ​​reviewing recommendations, it's really good~!!
It was my first time, so I went in and out several times, but the application was good and the color was good, and there was nothing on the mask.
By reviewing the reviews, more detailed information and color combinations are more stylish. Like ᆢ♡
Rom'n really catches the eye from the look~ I can't even use matte products because of dead skin cells. Hehe. Besides, that it doesn't stick to the mask (even tips that don't ask) I love it~ I'm completely steamed in Damju Beige~ I'm going to take a look right now It's a lot easier to choose after meeting with All Young TV.
And Olive Young is a fountain whose content never dries up...?? What's wrong with reviewing a review? Testimonials~~~ It's been a while since I've been on YouTube, but a notification popped up, so I came to see a rom&review and saw Olive Young trying something new every time... Rom&#39;s package design is so pretty~~ Once it comes out, I'm curious~~ Do you all have experience with a button to purchase?!! The overall quality of ROM&N is excellent, so it's really good to give as a gift~~ I wanted to take a closer look at the Hanbok package that came out this time on social media as well, but Olive Young God, who knows the hearts of coduks, uploaded a kind video like this>_ < Olive Young YouTube channel that evolves every time I watch it!! Who will be the protagonist of the next episode of glory... Personally, I would like to collect and review all-in-one products among men's cosmetics~~ Men's reviews are relatively small, so I had a lot of trouble deciding which product to use... but it's just light... Olive Young If you review your review and upload a video, I think it will be helpful to many people~~! So now I'm going to watch the video of Olive Young, which has been delayed in the meantime ^_^ Go to the next video~~
Whenever I try to purchase Olive Young online or offline, I go to the Olive Young app and read the reviews carefully before purchasing.

This is how I review Lima's #reviews and get sold out through the video, so how can I not buy and stand still?
I'll have to go to Olive Young to buy #Romand #See-Through MatteTint right now.
I hate shiny things, but I love the rom&see-through matte tint because it adheres well to the lips and is matte~
I also use rom and tint a lot these days and I love it!
All-Young, a place I often stop by when I go to work, is always beautifully displayed so I can spend a lot of money, from the design of the rom and tint container to the color
So pretty. Also, because of the mask, I don't like that it's oily, but it's attractive because it doesn't stick to the mask. I'll have to go again today.
Anyway, I live in Allyoung, but even if I search hard, I am giving up if I am not in Allyoung! All-Young, it’s hard these days
I've been using ROMN since it first came out, and it has become so famous.. The design this time around feels like a see-through hanbok, and even the patterns ROMN also have a sense
I love the honest review of rom and tint! It's an unfamiliar brand, but I want to buy it after seeing the reviews of All Young ^^ Please post more reviews like this in the future Subscribe Like Complete
It's like this every time.. We're Ohye ㅠㅠ I want to buy that one.. I want to buy that one.. ㅠㅠ He explains how to apply the lip too.. I really like it.
Subscribing to All Young TV! It's great to review the review. The actual usage video is also shown in great detail, and you can find out what you are curious about! If you point it out and let me know, it makes me feel cool!!! I look forward to more fun and useful videos! Awesome feeling!!!
Every time I buy a tint, I am the type of rich people who add to my worries, but the reviews are perfect, so I should buy it with confidence~~ I got it as a gift from a friend on New Year's Day

I have an Olive Young gift certificate, so I was searching for what to buy, but this is what I was looking for♡♡ Thank you to the editor.
I came to participate in the event and went to buy it,
It's content I found while fumbling around to buy a rom&n product, is it fate hahaha Besides, even an event,,️
The formula, color development, and the most important disappointment are detailed, so I think it will be of great help to your purchase. There are a lot of real steamed reviews on the Olive Young app, so it's great
I would like to purchase from Rom&Tint All Young, a craftsman that lasts for up to 5 hours ️
It's not a respectful word, it feels like a friend is reviewing it, and it's fun to hear a new coined word.
Tips are also useful.
Congratulations on the new YouTube channel of Olive Young!
rom men. Romanne, who really cares for all the tones and pulls out the colors evenly so that no tone is neglected ㅠㅠ I wrote a lot of reviews on All Young... Really holy.. ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I tried the Rouge Purple color and wanted to buy it so much that I had tears in my eyes, but when I saw this video, I looked up again.
Thanks for the good content :)
I'm so excited to review a review!! I don't even look at it because it's done at the speed Koreans like haha ​​After seeing it, I want to buy a rom & tint ㅠㅠ
Olyoung ♡ I love you ♡
This is how easy it is to purchase, so only products with good reviews are selected and made into a video~~^^
You really did a review ^^
rom and tint is really crazy!!!!
Is there anyone you don't know yet??
At first, I just bought it because the color is pretty, so should I try it? I like the pretty color + longevity + spreadability + scent.
Since it is a warm tone, I only bought all the colors that match the warm tone.
I thought the channel had changed! The video looks a lot cleaner. I like the see-through matte and it's so soft ㅠㅠ Give it more color.
I was thinking of buying a rom&n, but everyone said it was a life item, so I'll have to get one too!!
I've compiled only the best reviews, so I'll trust Olive Young and buy rom & tint right away. I'll follow the tips too.
Review the review Review the review !
I always refer to reviews when shopping, but as mentioned in the video, Allyoung has a lot of reviews, so I read it thoroughly before purchasing. latest? After thinking about it, I actually got tired of it, so I'll buy it later!! It's a common occurrence, but it's so groundbreaking that it's focused on the best reviews like this. These days, I use audiobooks to commute to and from work, so I think it would be good to go while listening to reviews of products of interest. Maybe that's why I use premium haha
rom and tint hanbok edition is so pretty
The color is good, wow!
Rom'n is so famous that there are hardly any people who haven't tried it lol It's a product I've tried and satisfied with~
I didn't know there was an All-Young TV~ Product reviews are so helpful and the videos are pretty~♡♡♡♡Subscribed and set notifications~Please upload more videos in the future!!♡♡♡
I pressed play and couldn't stop!!!!!!!
I'm going to Olive Young now....
Olive young YouTube's new look is so good
Thank you so much for your review. It's so good.
The rom & tint is so pretty~ It doesn't smudge and I can see the test like this. It's great. Thank you All Young TV~~ I can always go to Olive Young and test it.
Awesome... Content like this... ROM&amp;n’s products are all good. I will buy it right away.
The store I always look for is Olive Young!! The new products came in right away, which is great
It's a total hit thanks to All Young & Review.
Even if there are many good reviews every time I choose cosmetics
The blog was too long or had pictures, so it didn't really touch me.
Even people like me who aren't good at makeup show it like this.
The rom and tint is really cool~
Cheering on the new start of All Young TV!! I will recommend it to people around me a lot.
I want to try a matte lip, but I couldn't even try it because my lips are rich in dead skin cells, but I want to give it a try!!
The color is so pretty..TTㅠ Thank you for making the video review neat and easy to understand_! Please review moisture & moisturizing products that are good for very dry skin ️
I feel better about the all-young new look. I think I will visit more often. ^^ The hanbok edition is oriental, so it's more attractive. The color is pretty and it doesn't smudge, so I want more.
I really like the review of All Young TV
The person who explains it has a good voice and the detailed review makes it feel like I've used it myself.
All young, ten days!!!
Thank you for opening the event!!
Review the review. Like the corner! Lima's explanation is great too! My shopping cart is getting thicker too.
Necessary in the era of mandatory wearing of masks, which is trending these days!!!! It's a product♡ I'm going all-young right now~~~~ Letgo~~!!!
I watch All Young TV and learn makeup tips.. I put on shading and mascara right now ㅠㅠ I want a lot of glossy tints these days, so I'm looking for them, but Rohm'n's just popped up. You seem to be doing very well these days!! And All Young TV has so many useful things.
I really like the event ️ The tint color in the room is so pretty ️
Yeonji Bora Cooking!! Rom'n is also right~ I'm totally addicted to color restaurants~^^
There are all kinds of skin and beauty related Olive Young, so I only went to Olive Young. So comfortable. You will also get a lot of useful information by watching All Young TV often!
I also really like Rom&, it's really pretty and I'm definitely going to buy it!!!!!
Congrats on the new manager
These products are so good~~^^
I always support All Young TV~^^
At Olive Young, skin care, makeup, and daily necessities are all used! If you buy it after seeing product reviews on ️All Young TV ️, you don’t have to look for it separately and I think it’s really good
I felt it for the first time before seeing it
Romanne or Olyoung who recognizes that pretty thing
Remind me that both are brands I love so much.
I saw it ^&^ From the color to the formulation to the package, Rom'n is really good at picking things up, but I can't even hear the eye mask on this time.. Seriously, it's so pretty.
The idea of ​​reviewing a review is different!!
But I wish there was a video of digging up a one-star review too!!
I hope that you will receive a lot of good energy from the new year and wish you all the best in 2021.

These days, I can't stop using a matte lipstick, but I don't think I can't buy Rom'n's color. I'm going to buy it right now.
Congrats on the new look!
I am also satisfied with All Young products! Eye shopping is fun too! I give you lots of support
Rom&Hanbok Edition courage zone... I have dry lips, but it doesn't dry out and it doesn't stick to the mask, so I'll have to give it a try!
Subscribe, Like Done ○ All Young TV has been refurbished and is much better. It reads user reviews, shows color comparison well, and gets into your ears!!!!
rom&see-through matte tint I'm going to watch it with a popping voice. It doesn't smudge and the color is pretty.
The tint is as pretty as a peach color
I want to apply it haha ​​It's a nice color for spring to come soon~
Matte Lip Tint Indie There was a tint like this.. I was looking for a matte tint, but it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo great ㅜㅜ
Illegal event participants are caught. A person who participated in the event using as many as 5 multiple accounts.

Yo-yomi = Mong-ri = Puro = Love Met = Bacoco



For the fairness of the event, such a person must be excluded from winning. We ask the manager to make a wise decision.
congratulations on the new
I ended up using All Young because there were so many products and reviews, but I want to use it even more because of the renovation.
rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition! The case is so pretty~ I use Rom& Matte Lipstick well~ It’s matte and there’s no flaking of dead skin, so it’s better to wear a mask and not stick to it
ROM&N has a lot of real lip restaurants, and there are many different colors.
Ah, All-Young is so good ️ I am looking forward to it more after the renovation as All-Young TV ️
There were so many cosmetics that it was hard to choose, but you just pick one. always cheering
I was still looking for a lip that didn't smudge, so I'm going to test it out and buy it right now!
There is nothing to miss from the video from start to finish.
If it's a matte texture but a moist tint, it's a must-have item for my lips in the mask.. (I hate Yoplait) I'm thinking about the color.. It's somewhere between summer cool tones and winter cool tones, but what should I use?
I enjoyed seeing my darling Olive Young's newly refurbished look. She stopped by every lunch break to try out new products and bring them one by one so that I could forget about her work stress. Thank you so much~
If it is recommended by Olive Young, I will write it with confidence.
Olive young's new look!♡
I enjoyed the video!!♡
I look forward to more news in the future.
ROM&See-through Matte Tint is perfect from the packaging to the naming sense. The color is amazing and it looks even prettier when smudged. I really enjoyed watching this content.
rom&see-through matte tint is really great!
Actually, I didn't know Rom'n well before that.
For me, who has always given up on lip makeup because of the mask...
I was astonished at the scene where I applied tint and pressed down the mask!!
The rom & tint color is so pretty~ I have to go buy it right now because it's on sale until tomorrow~ haha
The gradient lip is so pretty!!!
From a review of a lip product that does not ask for a mask that is perfect for this time of year, even a hanbok edition!!! I'm at home, so I guess I'll have to apply this at home!!
The purple red color is so pretty!!
In an era where masks are essential, lip products are often overlooked or rarely found, but looking at these reviews, I am craving to purchase again. I will have to go get one before the Lunar New Year
I always refer to reviews for beauty items before making a payment, but since I am a parenting mom, reading reviews is also a job, so I am just grateful for the friendly All Young TV. We will continue to work with All Young TV for smart consumption. ^^
This is Olive Young part-timer! I think I did a lot of checking the stock of ROM & products while working for almost a year..
If you actually try the color, it's really soft and the tint's unique color is the same, so even I, who doesn't use tint, wants to buy it.. There were a lot of people who asked me to recommend a tint. I think that. In fact, while working part-time, I knew about the products in the store, but didn't know all of them, so I couldn't get it easily because of the professional explanation, even if I looked at the back of the product or went to the product's online official mall.

I think it will be very useful for part-timers...!
There is a lot of honey information, so I love it~ Ssangdabong♡
The safflower coral color is crazy haha
Please post reviews like this often!! It's good haha
I'm paying close attention! I'll have to buy it with reference to it. ^_^
Seeing these reviews about rom and tint makes me want to buy it!! ㅠ.ㅠ
I love the design of the rom & see-through matte tint hanbok edition too~
Allyoung's own review.. Surely it will be in the store?
I'm going to buy it right away.
I must try rom and tint ^^ It's so pretty!
Olive Young Fortress is going comfortably and I'm going to go again tomorrow!
We will deliver and look forward to content that may be unfamiliar to ordinary citizens in an easy and fun way.
Thank you for the diverse participatory content.
We hope that you will receive more love in the future. Fighting!
Singna Singna My regular All-Young~ Rom & see-through mat is still in Rouge Bora bag Please review Espoir's new product!!! It's quite expensive, so I want to see it in a video preview~
The color development of rom and tint is really good, so it's a good time to buy it right now. It's a hanbok edition, so it's a really good edition to commemorate the Lunar New Year~
The hanbok edition is so pretty ㅠㅠ I want all 4 colors
I need a base lip, so I'll try the combination of glasting water tint gardenia on Damju Beige!!!
I really like rom&n products for All Young!!
From the beginning, my favorite brand is rom&.
Rom and the color master ㅠ You pick the colors really well.
Among the tints released today, safflower coral is pretty.
A collaboration of All Young TV and review reviews, new content!! I always visit Olive Young and write a review, or I got my Dream delivered today and wrote a review, but now my review can be published on YouTube!! I'm so proud!! Whenever I buy cosmetics, especially skin care! I tend to look for reviews and buy them, but I really like the fact that I can now see reviews with videos in addition to photos and texts. If your first artist is Romanne, you can look forward to future lines as well! The new launch of Olive Young, which works hard even on YouTube!
I'm already using a lot of rom & tints, but looking at the reviews, the hanbok edition is also pompous.. I'm going to wear Yeonji Bora! rommen olmen...!!
I am very curious about the review of <Bobbi Brown Extra Lip Tint>~
Congratulations on the launch by reviewing AllYoungTV #review~
I look forward to many more fruitful, informative, and honest reviews of various products in the future.
The color is so pretty
I have to recommend it to my friends a lot.
AllYoung TV YouTube Existing subscription notification Like completed. We look forward to seeing more good content and news from you in the future. I wish you the best of luck always. I will visit often to receive news!!
I think it's the only product I've been using since I was in high school. ️Rom&️ The color development is good and the lasting power is long, and the price is affordable! I think it's a product made for students, but I've been using it consistently since I became an adult. I've only used rom & lipstick so far, but I want to try this hanbok edition. I'm looking forward to it *^^*

As someone who loves Olive Young, I really like the YouTube channel. Thank you. You have a lot of sense to speak quickly for Koreans who are in a hurry~!! I look forward to it a lot in the future!
I hope you can review the types of La Roche-Posay~~
ROMN has already been collected in my pouch
I love matte lipsticks, but I think the colors are so well chosen!
Haha I didn't know there was a tint like this out of rom & tint!! I'm going to check out the review!! I'm going to buy one because the color is good!!
The rom&n brand is a brand that I always love because I think it is a collection of good things such as color, color, atmosphere, brilliance of the case, and durability.
These days, I was only looking for a matte lip whenever I bought a mask, but there are a lot of chapped lips and a lot of chapped lips due to the gradation color development! Are you crazy about this tint???? You don't even ask about the jackpot mask.. I have to buy it right away. Who is buying the expensive one these days? Low price.
I used to buy and use Olive Young skin lotion, but I came across this video while looking for a cosmetic gift for my girlfriend!! I bought the rom & see-through matte tint hanbok edition reviewed in this video and gave it to my girlfriend, but she said it was so pretty and asked where she bought it. Thank you~ Please upload a lot of review videos, etc.!! (I'll watch them all~~) I'll have to think about what cosmetics to present next time!
This is the place I love so much all the time~~>_<
If you go to the real tint side, you can't get out of it haha
The design is pretty and the function is good, so I always get it~~
Cheer on you~ haha
I really like rom & tin, there is rom n tint in All Young, so if you go to my house for a while, it will be mine ♡♡
Please review about beauty accessories. I wonder if there are any cheap ones that are good value for money.
There are cosmetic cotton, non-woven fabric, and plump cotton. :)
When I buy cosmetics, I always refer to Olive Young as there are many reviews. full honey
Haha The products I usually use are in the TOP 5!! Also, my eyes are correct.
All Young! great! We wish you the best of luck with interesting content!
I love the new look of Olive Young~~!!
Thank you for your review. I want to go see the product.
I'll run right away
Rom'n's elegant color came out well. I'm adding this to my shopping cart
It's really convenient and nice to pick and organize only the best reviews.
I'm going to go buy the rom&see-through matte tint tomorrow
All-Young has been redecorated and is so much better~
ROMN that you can trust and use. The design is pretty and everyone is satisfied even if you give it as a gift. It gives you an opportunity to access ROMN more easily.
I tend to shop online and it's a brand I like, but I couldn't go to the tester, so I was only looking at color reviews.
If there's a downside, it's my eyes that look pretty.
My friends are always talking about it all the time, but the reviews are no joke.. hehe
Faith that can be felt in a straight voice! The screen composition is clean and the speed is good! Support All Young TV! ROM&N is so unbelievable!!! Isn't it? Hahaha Subscribe! great! Ku-wook!
Oh.... I haven't used ROMN, but I'm being socially distanced haha! It's convenient because I don't have to look for it myself because it collects reviews!!!!
Oh~~ you're young ^^
I wish I could review each type of deodorant.
I think it would be good to give the Hanbok Edition as a gift on New Year's Day!
I think it would be great for me who has good keratin.
I'll have to recommend it to my friends who only use ROMN!
I'm worried about what gets stuck.
The hanbok edition is really my go-to ㅜㅜㅜㅜ The courage and the beautiful color are so so pretty. I always worry about the keratin flaking of the sensible tint, but this is the best song ㅜㅜ
Wow, looking at it, I'm addicted to it, the Rom & Color is the best? I like coral, but the color expression is natural and I think it will go well with me~^_^ My desire to apply tint quickly is fulfilled ️ Olive young is love~~hehe
Wow, as expected, Romanne.. the color of rouge purple is crazy
I'm going to go buy one!!!
I think this content is fast and the delivery is good, so it's fun!!!
After seeing the video, I want to buy it.
All Young review video is so good
Not to mention the rom and tint design, the color development and
The condition that you must have as a tint is approaching.
I don't like sticky tinted products, but this is a matte type, so I love it ^^
I enjoyed the introduction of Olive Young's good products. The video creators are full of sincerity.
All Young TV is the best!! Have a really good day!
You can't not buy the rom&hanbok edition!!
I already bought it after seeing All Young reviews, but the color development is really good, the original color is the same as the luxurious package product selection.
Giving people more information! thank you

Sincere congratulations on Olive Young's new makeover!

I like the rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition product introduced through the video, from the design to the color, so I will visit tomorrow to test it and buy it. I am very much looking forward to the content!
With the AllYoung app, I order Today's Dream and give gifts to my friends on their birthdays, but in such a case, it is essential to order them hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahacollapse I'm so sassy hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, especially the popular commentary these days, I don't have time to get bored watching the rom and lip review video really hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha ;;But on the opening date, praise and praise what I can use I'm worried between the two, but coral is perfect for me, so it's difficult to create a gradation, so I applied only one matte lip every day, but I think I could do it well hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I really need to use blusher as a lip these days. It's easy to carry, so it's a perfect tip, so everyone should use it! Looking at it, he's very holic hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, don't forget to check your attendance every day! If you attend for 10 consecutive days to earn points for each cumulative attendance, you can even apply for an iPad giveaway, so go to work every day with the All Young app.
Olive young's new look is very nice~~

I really want to see reviews of cleansing products such as cleansing tissue.
I am really looking forward to it as it will be a precious opportunity to start 2021 new and beautiful with the new All Young. Thank you for your good review :)
I'm a bit sensitive to smells, so it would be nice if the reviews included a part about scents.
The video reviews it quickly so I like it. If you watch it, you will fall in love with it...!!!! All-young Yoo-Tyung Home shopping sisters work harder than the others,, Hall without knowing it

I am writing a list of things to buy at All Young,
Oh, I saw it. The color is so pretty. Why didn't you buy that? I just want to buy it.
It's best not to get the mask on at this time.
The mussel coral is really pretty! best
I think the various reviews will be really helpful!!!
I really like Rom'n's lipstick, but it's the hanbok edition!!! How pretty is the color development in a subtle yet unique style ㅠㅠ I want to have all of them in each color ㅠㅠ I can understand more questions about it and like it!!
If you have cosmetics you need or if the cosmetics you used run out, you will find them unconditionally!!!! Please always be by our side like now. I will always support you. I love you all young (Wow.. The safflower coral color in the video is so pretty.)
I'm using rom & pink fold tint well, but it's a new tint zone!!!
The lipstick on the mask is inconvenient and increases mask consumption.
I love this product just because I need it!! I will do it ♡
rom&see-through matte tint I love the elegant design and the moisture without flaking off the dead skin cells.
Damju beige is sweet and perfect for spring! I need to run to Olive Young right now to get it~~!!
The information you get through All Young TV is a world-class nuclear honey tip Thank you for the video suitable for sensible Koreans. I will refer to it and become a beautiful Korean citizen ️
The only store that was uncomfortable even for men to visit
I trust rom and lip, but I'm just grateful that you brought it with you in such detail.
The color of the tint is coming. It doesn't even stick to the jackpot mask.. Hot items in the corona era will be coming soon tomorrow♡♡
All Young Rom &
The intro video based on steamed reviews is very good....
Review the review~ The video is so interesting~

The color of the rom and tint is so pretty~
I'll take a good look at the reviews. Also, this is the best
Rohm and Tint Life Tint... It's Korean, but it's very pretty from the stylish case.
What's the color... It's so bright and the texture looks like it's been blurred with a soft texture... Haha I'm going to go buy the safflower coral right now!!! Next time, please review body products ♡
Rom & Tint is great. I reviewed the review and enjoyed it!! best!!
At first, I saw Safflower Coral and thought it was mine, but after reviewing it ...all the colors are my favorite lines ,,,, really ㅠㅠ Rom'n can't be satisfied with just one!!
It's release date sticker Personally, I'm so bummed, what's the first thing? But it will be really helpful later!!
[Sujeong] I am a man and I really like Olive Young~~ I only use strange cosmetics every day.
My sister, who is a fan of Olive Young, bought it at Olive Young for a long time and tried it.
But why did a man do that?
One day, the moment I accidentally used Olive Young products, my legs lost strength and I collapsed.
You are doing a really good review. I like it. out of five stars
Next time, I'll ask for a pâté. Since I put on the mask, my skin has deteriorated rapidly.
Congratulations on your YouTube channel renewal!!
Please review rom & juicy lasting tint apple brown!
rom and tint looks so pretty!! It's great to see reviews too!
Oh look at the speed. Also All-Young! Believe and live Olyoung! Toner and essence ran out, so I went to get a coupon to order Dream Dream, and came back after hearing the news that All Young TV was open! After all, All Young TV is just my style! Plus rom & review! I was still keeping an eye on it, hey! Also, you know my heart well! The subtle color, the color development is good, and the package is pretty, but what can I say about the hanbok edition? It's also great to give as a gift, so it's so easy to decide this month's friend's 2nd birthday present! Please work hard on All Young TV! I will come every day! :) Congratulations - All Young TV renewed!
The tint restaurant, Rom'n.... I've seen a lot of friends use it since some time ago, but now my pouch is full hehe It's cumbersome to wipe it off because the tint is often stained on the entrance part, but I'm satisfied because it lasts well!!! Rom and everyone..
I like the detailed review of the mast smear test and color development shot ㅠ
I started buying from Olive Young this year. There are many good products. I support you.
Olive Young, you're working hard today as well..... My wallet...
Oh, I'm reviewing a review... I'm looking forward to an honest review, not an advertisement, with Olive Young...
If it's Koduk, there's no one who doesn't know Romanne.
The color of the tint, the formula, and the color development are so good, but a pretty package that shakes the hearts of coduks.
It's too much of a drinker ㅠㅠ Every time a new product comes out, my bankbook goes with it.
Rom & everyone, work less and make more money
When watching YouTube, I always set the speed to 1.5x and watch it without needing to adjust the speed, it's my favorite speed! I read the review of rom & tint, the master of color.
Rom&.. Yeonji Bora ㅠㅠ She's so pretty ㅠㅠ Can't you re-release it?
I was looking for a tint review, but I liked that Allyoung put together the cuts at once. I saw this and joined the romen hanbok edition???hehe
The speed is just moderately fast, but it comes in easily. I feel like I crammed the test a little with the genealogy and did well the next day..? It's been a long time since I watched a video without pressing after 15 seconds.
 ! All Young TV & review review and launch!
The first artist of the review, Rom and Tintrani, who I've been interested in lately! I like soft lips and matte lips, but in winter my lips get dry and tight, and when I apply it, my lips are messy and flaky. It's on sale and it's a very coveted product!
I need to decide what color to live
The color is really pretty ^^ haha
Very good
Hearty congratulations on all-young's new makeover!

'New All-Young' TV', like a sparrow mill, is shining brightly, and I think it will become more popular in the future!
I am looking forward to seeing the reviews of new lip products so I can purchase them with confidence.
I lost my tint so I had to buy something, but I need to buy a rom and tint!! I was looking for a tint that was pretty and moist in all colors, but Romn is the answer, it deserves to be number one!! I'm going to buy it right now
I liked the video like reviewing the review~
In addition to simply promoting the product, there is also a product video by looking at other people's opinions,
The product is completely different from what you see on the internet.
When I actually bought it and it was different from what I expected, the disappointment...
All young is full of only things that I really love.
rom and tint purchase
How pretty? Go Go Go Go with All Young!
Sincere congratulations on the new makeover of Olive Young.
Makes me want to buy them all. Thank you All Young TV.
I like the unique softness of rom&tint.
What's the color of the room and tint? I'll have to test it at the store.
I really want to buy Damju Beige!!!!!!
Congrats on the renovation of All Young TV~ After reviewing the review and watching the video, I want to go to Olive Young to buy Room & Lip~~!! The color is good and the lip skin tone is even recommended!! In the future, I will have to buy the recommended products while watching the review videos on AllYoung TV ^^ Complete AllYoung TV Subscribe & Like I will come back often~!! I support All Young TV
The real rom& is awesome!!!!!
I'm a bit confused about what to choose. Thank you. You're going to have the perfect tint this time!!
rom and tint is really pretty
It's really nice that it doesn't stick to the mask
It's perfect for creating a gradient lip!
I'm a cool-toned person, but Peace Pigeon really suits all of them.
uh? I've heard of Rom & Matte Tint too, but it's nice to see something that people around me recommend like this on Olive Young TV haha^^
The new YouTube channel of Olyoung, the mother of beauty,
Of course, I am still helping people to get a lot of good news through social media, but in the future, more and more, more and more, please review everything on YouTube as well All Young TV!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I believe in Olive Young. I am planning to visit today and tomorrow.
We will deliver and look forward to content that may be unfamiliar to ordinary citizens in an easy and fun way.
Thank you for the diverse participatory content.
We hope that you will receive more love in the future. Fighting!
Congratulations on opening Olive Young YouTube. he
I bought it after seeing the rom and tint video.
I want to Not even on the mask
Wear hanbok for the upcoming Lunar New Year and complete it with the rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition!
I couldn't use a lot of mats because of the dead skin cells, but I'm going to try it now after taking good care of it!! I need to buy a birthday present soon, I hope I win!!
Rom&.. a brand that customers are looking for a lot if you are working all-young This lip product is very pretty, especially safflower coral, warm tone, cool tone, a devilish color that brightens all faces This salary is you.
Wow Olive Young's new content is so good...?
Who is the person who creates new content with good plans every time...? I'll take you in that direction...
Rom'n's are so good because they don't like it, but when you think about why it doesn't, of course, the biggest thing is that it doesn't lean towards either warm or cool.
I was always worried about the wide spectrum of colors, but whenever that happens, the place I go to is the Olive Young mobile app!
A friendly color review solves the problem of which one to buy at once~~~
I knew the rom&n color was pretty, but I'm going to go buy a matte tint! I'm looking forward to the review video coming up in the future.
I'm using Damju Beige, no dead skin cells. The color is really pretty.
I sincerely congratulate you on the new renovation of Olive Young.

I want to give you a rom and tint..
This video is very helpful..
Review the reviews and listen carefully to the detailed reviews
I thought the Rom&Hanbok Edition was really fresh and cool, but it's also the number one selling product in All Young.
Congrats on the new look!
Good luck in the future~
Was the hanbok edition released with a tendency to Lunar New Year's Day?
Testimony that I'm a color gangster~
The review is so good that it is a review ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
rom and tint is so pretty.. the color is pretty!!
I want to buy each of those colors.
There is not much to be buried..
I like this video I wish I could review aftershave products as well.
We will continue to support you in the future.
Wow.. I really like the idea of ​​rom & hanbok edition, the color is better
I think rom&n chooses the best color. I don't worry about lip products and I am unconditionally rom&. Warm tones and cool tones are the best colors for each tone, and there are no side effects such as exfoliation of dead skin cells or itchy lips. I am satisfied with the price, color and quality, so I am not missing anything.. Every time I go to Olive Young, Romn always tests and buys one. They always make good products.
I am also very grateful to Romn~ I am also very grateful to Allyoung for allowing me to purchase Romn at Olive Young, a store that is easily accessible in everyday life.
The color is very nice ^^
Please review hair products as well! There are a lot of different likes and dislikes about hair products, and I had to read a lot of reviews.
Wow, this time, Tina paid a lot of attention to the design. It's a tint specification, because it's a rom& that I really trust. Hahaha I like the color of the orange nude pine tree, so I used the tostin nude well, but it's a damju beige docxatem.
The color master Rom&especially Rom&Tint has a lot of colors that warm tones will like, so I wonder if the owner of Rom& is a power warm tone.
After reading the reviews, I can't stand it.
Great tips too
I'm going to have to wipe out the olive young.
Rom'n is also a lip master!! how much i like
When it comes to tinting, it's rom&! A product that captures color development and durability at the same time!
Isn't it so much fun to just read reviews? I watched it and it's over...
Oh ~~ The color is so pretty!!
I sometimes buy tints for my sister, but it's amazing. I really like this video ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Thank you! After all, Olyoung, my heart is getting bigger
Thanks for the review. i need to buy one
Oh, I didn't know that Olivier Young, who I often go to, is also active on YouTube.
Every time my girlfriend went all year round, I went to the tint and asked about it haha ​​I think burying is the most important factor in the Corona era, is it okay?!
Damju Beige + Gardenia Beige Honey Combination Approved!
If you're a warm-toned person, you have no choice but to win the invincibility...

And safflower coral was completely attacked by my taste.
It has been refurbished as All-Young TV, congratulations
Please continue to provide detailed and thorough reviews in the future.
The design of the rom&hanbok edition is so good that the desire to buy it is boiling just looking at the design.
The color has faded so well and the durability is amazing... I'll have to run it all the time tomorrow
I really like Olive Young, but of course I have to subscribe to it~ Hehe I'm using Rom & Shadow and Tint right now, and the color is pretty and I love it! The design is also simple and pretty.>3<
I'm cheering for Olive Young's YouTube channel~~♡ One million and ten million Gazzah!!!
I think it's good to see only things that need reviews!
But first of all, this new rom & color is crazy;;
All the colors are pretty ^^
The color of the fine tint case is so pretty. I avoid matte tints because my lips tend to tan often, but after seeing the real reviews in the video, I will definitely buy this one ️ The adhesion and durability without smudging are top notch in the tint world! Tell me what~ What are you saying 08 Monghwa Coral You are mine~
All Young~ Both online and offline
I'm using it well~ ^^
I always want to buy and there are many good products
Fun to choose, fun to use ^^
I'm fishing again. Even if she's pretty, she's so pretty~ Is it okay to be like this all year long? Even if my wallet is stolen, my heart is heavy... I love you today. All Young TV
ㅜㅜ All-Young gets discounts every day and if you even leave a review like this, you will automatically subscribe.
From appearance to taste
I like this review I want to buy it right now
I'm going to rob my bankbook again like this..
There are many things to note, but the sticker with the opening date is the most impressive. There aren't many people who use cosmetics according to the expiration date and expiration date. Besides, the tint often stimulates the desire to buy something else, so there is a high probability that I won't be able to use it until the end.
All the tint colors are so pretty!!!
At the end of every month, I only wait for the all-new sale. Why is the Hanbok edition package so elegant? ㅋㅋ And there is definitely less staining. Good Good Rom'n is a true color craftsman. The shades and tint colors are great. This month I'm going to go all out for the Rom'n Hanbok edition~!!!!
Olyoung is near my house, so I go all the way around once a week ㅋㅋ What should I buy today? Are there any items that Olyoung and top reviewers picked for me? It makes my wallet empty.. But every time the products pile up in my cosmetics storage, I'm so happy and want to brag about it ㅠㅠ.. I love you Olyoung Really, first half of VVIP achievement Comment ♡
Rom&Tint has good color development and is reasonably priced. And above all else, I think the design is so pretty ^^ So I threw it away this time!
Thanks to Olive Young YouTube, I know a lot of honey items!
Thank you always~~!
Romanne came to me who couldn't even look at the mat because it's completely dry. As if it was applied or not, I don't even care...!! I had trouble deciding because all the colors were pretty, but safflower coral..very..good..
By the way, what is the video speed?
Everyone knows about rom & tint restaurants, safflower coral is so pretty~ rom n put a straw in my bankbook
4 married? I'm using it for the 3rd time, and her writing power is good and her lips look so much prettier ㅠㅠ
Really, go all young and look at the colors. They are really pretty ㅠㅠ
There is a warm school, and it is a must see.
Room and tint case you'll fall in love with at a glance
The color development and durability are both good. I especially like the red color, and I really like it.
Two votes not to ask the mask
I'm going to Olive Young to buy a moisturizing cream, so I'll have to bring it with me♡
The glow tint doesn't stick and it's the best
I was surprised that the color remained the same even after eating.
After all, if it's rom and tint, it's tint, if it's tinted, it's the color of the rom and tint master. I'm the only one who wants to buy them all..?
It makes me want to fill all my dressing tables with ROMN.
The fact that the lip doesn't stick to the mask seems to be a really optimized tint in this day and age!!!>< Awesome
I'm looking forward to the next review.
I'm reviewing AllYoung TV's review and I'm enjoying it. Even if you don't have time for each one, having an All-Young TV is very helpful. Let's talk together!
The new look is so pretty and it makes me want to go there again!! It's right in front of my house, so I go there often~~^^
I need to buy rom and tint right now!!!
It's a place I go to every once in a while because it's nearby.
I am always fascinated by new products.
I think All Young TV's new look has been freshly updated. Among the many reviews, I pointed out only the points, and besides, I was sucked in without any boredom at the speed of speech that Koreans like. [Review the review] I'm going to get a glossy lip right away from the first painting rom and tint to the big beneficiary event. This is why I can't miss every plum blossom because of All Young TV. They take care of everything from raw content to events. [Review reviews] Here's someone who will become a big fan I'll keep looking
Once you start using ROM&N, you can't get out of it... Cool tones and warm tones come out so comfortable to use, there are no colors to throw away,,!! It's a cool tone, but sometimes it doesn't suit me to come out with a cool tone item, but the rom & cool tone item is perfect, I want to have all the cool tone items.
Yesterday, I went to All Young to apply Bioderma Moisturizing Cream and cleansing, but it's a rom & tint video..! I'll have to get it soon haha ​​It's nice to see the colors and even a review so it's good for reference. I enjoyed watching the video.
Yoron honey information is very welcome!
All-young redecorated ️️️ It's fast paced Chan I lost my tint, so I'm looking for it, but I really like the rom & case
To be honest, I came to watch the video to participate in the review event, but rom & tint was sold...^^ It's an item I've been contemplating on whether to buy or not, so I'm getting more and more out of business. I think it's good because it's definitely released. I think it will be especially useful when you can't buy it after comparing it directly in an offline store haha ​​Even I was surprised by the high quality and reviews better than most beauty YouTubers... I also want to see reviews of famous Olive Young packs.
All-young, who has been renovated, is neat and luxurious
I read the review for rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition. I also think it's unnamed! I think the color is good, the spreadability is good, and the coloring power is great. Personally, I really like Safflower Coral. It's great that you've compiled only the best reviews of these great products! We hope that All Young TV will always provide benefits, joy, and happiness to visitors. We hope that it will receive love and attention from many people as it is a lively and enjoyable space of happiness that has always been operated with the same unchanging heart as in the beginning.
I think I'll try lip products after a long time~ It looks great without even putting on a mask
I really like Olive Young><Once I enter, I want to buy everything, I stop and come out.. The basic 1 hour is enough. Why do I want to buy so many things?? Olive Young is awesome~!!
Please do a lot of good events ♡
I enjoyed the tint collection video. I think it would be good as a gift. I'll have to buy one too.
I bought a water tint on the recommendation of Yuhwa-i, and my mom and I are pulling the mulberry.
When I go to Olive Young, I focus on new products.
I used to just test the colors, but it's really nice to know these details like this Hanbok edition design, tint texture, tip shape, tips when wearing a mask, expiration date stickers, etc.. It's like a product that comes out with great care, so I'm making a good impression on Rom'n through this video haha ​​Going to see Olive Young relieves stress, I'll have to run and test it today hehe I'll come see you often
These days, thanks to the role of the mask (?), the desire for tint has disappeared, but after watching the review video, the dying desire spurted!! Olive Young is also my wallet thief...
It's because of the weather, I can feel the dryness all the time, so the moisture is so dry that the dead skin cells and troubles keep happening~
Body troubles are getting worse these days, so I hope you can review items that will take care of these troubles ^^
rom and tint is really steamy
It's so nice to be able to see a video review on Olive Young.
It was difficult to check the color only from the review photos, but there is a color review.
I want to choose a color, and I want to buy more of ROMN, so please review the mask wearing shots often♡
It's digestible, so I'll have to go take a look!
It was a product line that automatically shouted rom-men.
The package was so pretty, my eyes caught my eye, but the color was pretty, it spread well and it was a product that didn't smudge!!!
I'll have to go to Olive Young to test the color development and buy it myself!!
rom and tint
It's really perfect for a gift and I want to make it a must-have ㅠㅠ I love All Young's products so much that I want to have them all. I'm looking forward to more pretty products in the future.
The new look is so pretty I'm subscribed and I'll come visit often
Congrats on all-young's new makeover~ ˃̵͈̑ᴗ˂̵͈̑
It's a store that I use well - I can trust you
Brighten up the New Year with Olive Young
Oh All-Young is being redecorated! Thank you for the good quality video. The video quality is very good!
They all look so pretty and good, so I'm even more worried!
There is a charm that prevents you from coming out empty-handed when you enter Olyoung, so I often go shopping with Olyoung's daughter~~^^
I love Rom'n's products! I think it would be nice to give it to my girlfriend as a gift.
Allyoung is good because it has a lot of reviews
The room and tint review is great. I really like it haha
Rom & Hanbok Edition First of all, the case was so pretty and the color was pretty, so I was curious about the color development!!! It's really pretty!!
I really like this review ㅠㅠ Detailed review like a beauty YouTuber I really like the new content ㅠㅠ All young Chingchae ㅠㅠ
I wish I could review the moisturizing line ampoules!!!!
It's cold and dry these days, so hydration is essential.
Subscribe, like, review, comment, finished. Thanks to Rom&Tint Pompu, I'm going to buy it, but I won an event, so I really want to receive a gift!!! ️️
Awesome Room and Tint is so pretty. ^^ I really like matte tints, but I really like the texture and feel of applying them. Especially since it doesn't shed much, it's my favorite tint.^^
ROM&amp;n’s color development is the best! It makes me want to run with Olive Young.
After seeing the Olive Young No. 1 tint review, I want to go and buy it right now.

I've tried it myself and I'm very happy with the color and the color.

Olive young products are called short cuts.
Rom & Hanbok Edition is awesome...
If you carry it with you, it will be ticklish.
It is a very necessary item now that I wear a mask because there is little smearing!!
rom-men
You've changed so much all year round, she's so pretty with her new look.
I have to go to the Woolyeong store and buy stuff and decorate it pretty.
Olive Young Have fun this year.
I will support you hard. Fighting!!!
There is no need to hesitate after seeing the color development reviews!
I often go all year, but each store wears different products, so I walk in vain, but I wish there were more variety of products ^^
And I want to have a tint. If I don't wear a mask, I want to wear it every day ^^
Wow.. the hanbok edition is so pretty ♡♡
I only use rom&n, but I have to go all year to get a new one.. It doesn't smear in the mask era like these days, and the color development is great..♡
Marketing to promote the beauty of elegant and elegant Korean tradition by engraving the delicate colors and traditional Korean patterns used in hanbok on the rom & see-through matte tint case! I really appreciate it~ You stand out even more~ Romn, who made a product inspired by hanbok, is also a representative of K-beauty.
And when I read the review earlier, it said that it had a sticker on the opening date.
Also, the color is pretty and it's nice to be able to use it regardless of warm and cool tones. Anyway, in many ways, this hanbok edition is a complete collection.
I want to do makeup with Espoir Real Ari Palette and see a review! I'm curious because everyone's color development and reviews are extreme!!!
I bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it!
thank you !!!
All Young TV Fighting!
Congrats on the new manager
Every time I hear the new Olive Young.. YouTube is also the same hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha !!
The pastel case is so pretty.
All-Young Subscription Like Done! I use it often, but I think it would be great to receive news about new products on YouTube!
ROM&Review is impressive.
I look old and dry because I have a lot of dead skin cells and wrinkles on my lips.
The matte lipsticks also come out so pretty, and because of Corona 19, it's always a mask, but it was stressful because of the smearing on it ㅠㅠ If I use the mask again, it smears on my lips ㅠㅠ It doesn't even stick to the real mask and sticks to it!! Thank you again for reviewing as if you were looking at it from a close distance ^.^ As expected, Oliveyoung is the best!! The design is so beautiful to carry around♡ Damn also review the velvet blood veil~ Olive Young~ Please review it~ Love you~
Oh, I throw away the mask and look forward to the spring day looking forward to seeing a pretty tint bar.
I really like Olive Young, a brand I go to often, so please become a YouTube channel that communicates ♡
It's a difficult time, but thank you for the great event
I look forward to innovative and diverse contents in the future.
Let's be together in 2021 ♡♡
The rom & color is so pretty!!
It's nice to collect and show only the best!!
rom n is love
ROMN that you can trust and write ️️️
Always thank you Olive Young
We hope that you will continue to receive love and interest from many people in the future.
Congrats on the new one, happy new year
Congrats on all-young new soy sauce. I always support you hahahaha I also like rom&tint, so I'm looking forward to the new product.
I always use Olive Young.
The new refurbishment and renewal are great.
I always support you
I was having trouble with tint greed, and then I was treated with Corona.. After seeing this, I want to buy it.. Don't tempt me..!!!
It's nice to have a new all-young look.
It doesn't even stick to the rom & mask.
The color is pretty.
I want to try Rom'n.
The color is so pretty haha
I want to try Room and Tint. There is Olive Young in front of my house. I want to go see it.
We support Olive Young, who always communicates.
Wow, I like the newly-renovated Olyoung.
I made a note of it, I'll have to refer to it when buying a gift~!^^
Can a tint be this pretty?
I'm always worried about what to buy, but thanks for such a good review every time.
Thank you, I think I can use better tints thanks to you ㅜㅜ
I think there are only cheap and good olive young products.
It's a hanbok edition, so it's perfect for a holiday this New Year's Day-^^
The rom and tint color is fantastic...
Reviews are more fantastic
I first came to know about ROM&amp;n’s products, All Young TV. I have always been satisfied with the products I bought from All Young, but now I am satisfied with the product.
It is advantageous to review a review.
I also like the color review.
All-Young~~~ You have a sense of humor~~~
The speed of speaking reviews is completely tailored to Koreans~~~~
And the color + texture genius rom & ㅠ ㅜ
I was going to buy it after Kosi Guk was over, but I'm going to go buy Yeonji Bora tomorrow ㅠ
The color is great~ I'm going to buy rom&~~
I thought Rom'n was famous only for shadows, but the lips are pretty too!
rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition safflower coral color is good!
The color of the rom and tint is really alive ^^ It's a tint I covet
These days, I'm logging in to Olive Young every day. From 2021 onwards, if the check-in date is more than 10 days, iPads will be drawn by lottery, but the u-top event giveaways are plentiful, and the giveaways are also distributed at Olive. Hehe, I want to say that I am doing a good job. I can't go to the store anymore because of Corona and because of my baby after giving birth, so my fingers are limp, but I'm almost living on the AllYoung app these days. Now, I think I'm going to live on youtube. Can't it be done every day? There, while making gags these days, it was fun to laugh at young teens in their 20s, and to be robbed on a first-come, first-served basis. I'm planning to stay at home with a newborn baby ㅜㅜㅡ Olive is more fun than TV... Now if I fall into utop, is there no way out?
Which products are right for me? Tint product information I was curious about, as well as the pros and cons, as well as the fine details ~ WOW !!!
I really like it because it introduced meticulously and easily as if I had used it myself ^^
The best review holy land that will make a happy new spring start with pleasant discounts and events.
#OliveYoung #AllYoungTV I look forward to hearing from you in the future~♬
Review the review!!! Isn't something unique? Rohm and Tint is one of the god rain items that I love so much~ I look forward to seeing more reviews from Review Master in the future~ Keep working hard on All Young TV~~!!
If Olive Young recommends it, I will definitely buy it and run.
I want to wear hanbok and go buy all those lines...
Safflower Coral, the color I was looking for!! I'll have to look for reviews on All Young TV in the future.
Whoa, what's with this speed? Even the timeline has a good sense! I'm curious about the eyeshadow palette review that will help with eye makeup that is more prominent in the Corona era >_<
I like to use rom&n lipstick, and the tint is pretty. Personally, I like the damju beige color.
After reviewing the review, I think the content is very good~~ haha
I'm going to go buy the rom & matte tint right now. Wait for Olive Young..
There are only junk products.
Rom'n is really steamed!
I buy a lot after watching the Olive Young review video ^^
It would be better if you explained the review in detail.
I think olive young is very good~
I want to see the set composition of All Young products by price range! For example, a 10,000 won set, a 30,000 won set, and a 50,000 won set like this~!
One more ~ ​​There are so many types of masks these days, please review Lima for each type by function~!
Like subscribe to Olive Young, I'll keep the alarm and wait~! All Young-chan~!
What's up with you all~~ As expected, you're doing a good job ㅠㅠ Even actively promoting the Rom&Brand ㅠㅠ That's a cool tone, but Honghwa Coral is so pretty!! I need to go to All Young and apply it right now!! All my pocket money is taken by Olyoung.
Watching the video makes me want to run to Olive Young haha
I like this review :)
Olive young ten days recognition recognition!!!
Nice to see you all young tv. Lots of good videos please.
Olive young is so good!
This is my best~^^
Unnie, please review the Celebr Chiffon perfume too.
I'm curious about that Sophia and Venus? and Chloe ㅜㅜ
The rom & color is so pretty.
rom n tint is the best
Congrats on 1st place
I like the expiration date sticker.
I like All Young products.
I come here every time I buy cosmetics.
Have a nice day ^^
Is this the place where the name was changed to Allyoung TV and a new corner was created?
I came here after hearing the rumors ^^
I will scrape it with All Alain Guide instead. I enjoyed it every time, but I will work hard even if I review the reviews.
In 2021, please take responsibility for my bankbook too.
I have to go all year round to buy rom and tint~~
Rom & ㅠㅠ The design is so brilliant, the color and texture are perfect ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Thank you so much for thinking of cool tones too ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Because the number of reviews was small, I was curious about the new product's formula, color development, durability, staining, etc., so I could see a review that was very detailed and pointed out even the shortcomings.
so so so so good
I was hesitant to buy it, but after reviewing the reviews, my desire to purchase is growing. I have to buy it!!!!
The water tint hanbok edition is also very pretty.. I met a velvet type these days, so my dry lips were upset, but this is it!
These new looks ..... Thank you so much ️
It's a secret to read Olive Young reviews when buying products every day.
I was surprised that my girlfriend wore this and didn't ask.
I'm going to go buy another pretty lipstick this time.
Olive young review is real honey! I really like Rom'n ㅜㅜ The tint is also good, but it's even better because there are a lot of different products.
What is Olyoung!!!!!
Also, it's so nice to work hard every time ️
Really, please work hard for the rest of your life.
Speed ​​is crazy....!!
The event is really good, but the commercials are really well shot. I'm going to buy rom&s now.
Seriously, I just went to Olive Young and looked for a review, but I really like the review.
color crazy
Rom&n is really good at picking colors regardless of the warm cool. I think he cares a lot about the consumer above all else. Yesterday too, I asked for a clear cushion, so it arrived today.
It seems like Romanne is really looking through my heart what kind of color and texture she likes...Olive Young knows that too, so it's great to take a texture video right away, it doesn't even stick to the mask and it's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooyoung knows that
I support All Young TV~

Among the rom&n shades, lip products are always my go-to, but this time, they are bright and attractive.

All Young Review When I entered the Olive Young app, there are so many that you can shop without failure even if you read the reviews carefully and purchase!!♡
As much as I always get a lot of help from reviews, I think I want to be helpful to other people by keeping my reviews right!!
All-Young Renovation~~~~~~~~~~~~It's so cool^^Your tint is pretty~~Gakoffdang~~~~I always support you
Oh!!! I bought Damju Beige as soon as this hanbok edition came out.
Subscribe Like Required~ I applied!
Review the review Corner is really clever. Olive Young is a real idea, great marketing... I'm writing a review, but I think I'll write more hard in the future because I want to be featured in a review. I came in and was sold by Honghwa Coral, so now I have logged on to Olive Young haha ​​I was so sad that the All-Alain Guide was over, but thank you for coming to this new corner. Congrats on the new renovation of Olive Young, I wish you more prosperity
Safflower Coral
This is a story for me who is warm and fussy~~~~
The color is so pretty...
I'm looking forward to where the next one will be
tint ㅁ ♡ so pretty
The first artist is my favorite brand, Rom&, ㅜㅜ Still, I was thinking about whether or not to buy this tint all-young app yesterday while looking for it in the tint All Young app.
The speed is crazy, I like it
Olive Young, which has more reviews than famous review apps, has compiled only the best reviews.
I can't help but watch
I'll let my acquaintances know about it so we can watch it together and go shopping.
It's so good ㅠ.ㅠ The video and review are really impressive.
I enjoyed the content of review quality in 2020, and I think this content will be useful too! In particular, I was very surprised that they even pointed out the disappointing things. I will be waiting for the basic product to come out in the next review review,,,,, I think it will be fun to compare reviews because the effects are so different for each person! I will work hard to write a review in the future.
I want to buy it, but there are too many, what should I do?
To welcome the new year, Seong Olive Young has released a clever content. How are these useful things?
It's coming out of my head haha
As a subscriber, thank you
I will be waiting for a lot of honey information in the future.
I'm going to go buy rom and tint
The see-through matte tint is really pretty, so I ordered 2 of them, and 1/3 of the tints at home are romane.
Quickly buy ROM&N, which is full of color and color lasting power~
Olive young rom & tint purchase desire rises to the left,,,!!!!! I have a lot of trouble with pimples on my face mask, so please recommend a good product for my troubles~~~
You are coming back with All Young TV!!! Thank you for coming back with a good program ️
The product is explained in more detail through reviewing the review, so I think it will be very helpful when purchasing ️️
And Rom'n is a real rib restaurant!!!!!!! The hanbok edition is also really pretty.
I want to present Rob & Burn Wrap. The color is pretty!!
Subscribe/Like Done
This edition of Hanbok is a product that I want to praise highly in that it preserves tradition. I feel proud of the beauty of Korea, which I don't usually feel, with tints while preserving the strengths of rom&n's tint.
Heck, reviewing reviews hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Romanne-chan.. I'm going to buy it ㅜㅜ
It's like a watercolor painting... Rom & Hanbok Edition Johnye! And the narrator's voice is cute and immersive, so it's pecking
Romanne....
I like the review+coloring video!!!
When I look at reviews, I usually check the bad points of the high-rated reviews and the good points of the low-rated reviews. Be sure to check what common opinions are.
Olive young, who explains many reviews in a simple and easy way, but also in detail and shows them well ㅠㅠ Isn't it really God Live Young? The color of rouge purple in the video is so pretty ㅜㅜ Isn't it so pretty??
A must-see for a bear hand makeup artist like me
I can live to see
Olive young YouTube is so good!!
Thank you so much for finding only the reviews you need among the numerous reviews.
There are many kinds of daily necessities in Olive Young cosmetics.
ROM&N is a true color restaurant!! The hanbok edition is so pretty♡ It's not too dry and the color is great... I have other rom & lip, but there is only a see-through matte line.
I heard the news and ran away!! As expected, All Young.. ㅠ Every time I buy a product, I always have to find out which products are good one by one, and they all said that it was good, so it was difficult to choose which one suits me better ㅜㅜ I got a lot of help from watching All Young YouTube. Informing you more effectively with content...!! Oh my God, thank you so much ㅜㅜ Please take good care of me in the future! I will see you better haha
Anyone who knows what the name of the 2nd (second right) color in the thumbnail is ㅠㅠ Can you tell me?
Wow, I think the new content is really good. I'm a fan of All Young, so whenever I buy a product, I always use the Olive Young online mall to look for the product and always look for reviews! Sometimes, there are so many reviews and there are so many different people, so I was worried about which part to believe because the reviews were all different, but you put so many reviews so neatly ㅜㅜ Your pronunciation is so good and today's lip color is absolutely crazy. I'm going into the mall haha ​​Next time, I want to review the 'Premium Line' review! Thank you for always good videos
All Young TV is great.
It is good to consider the user's point of view as to the recommended method.
Who is in charge of planning... Please review reviews and continue content in the future
I saw the news that YouTube is also being renewed, but it looks like it will be upgraded like this... The new look suits you so well, please upload a video until all products are reviewed..
What a review with an extraordinary sense of speed 129!!! totally my style
A new all-young that makes you want to watch it again and again with a sense of rhythm because it's sad to review it without any empty corners of this audio
From a buyer's point of view, thank you very much for collecting and reading only the core of ROM&amp;n's product reviews.
ROM&amp;n’s exterior is hanbok style, so the pattern and color are so pretty. I've been sold because of a nonsensical review.
I haven't bought a lip in a year, but I'm going to buy the rom
I don't think there are any products I buy without looking at reviews these days. I haven't used lip well since I started using the mask these days, but I feel like I'm obsessed with something in this video. Looking forward to more reviews from you in the future!!
Please review Dr.G The Moisture Barrier D Intense Cream~ I'm debating whether to buy it during this sale ^^
Isn't the hanbok edition so pretty ㅜㅜ It's a sensuous color and design.... Rom'n works really hard.... There is no smudging and the color is the same hehe The All-Young Channel is the best for detailed, high-quality reviews!!
It's nice to be able to give you a gift at a discounted price.
There are still two days left, so I'll have to go go shopping.
There is no need to worry about holding an event like this before the Lunar New Year.
I'm happy that the desire to buy is soaring right away.
Olive young tintrol is so pretty♡♡
It's so good that you can see the pros and cons of the product more clearly by summarizing the reviews! Besides, I like the design of rom & see-through hanbok too..♡ I want to try Honghwa Coral the most~^^
The speed is fast and there is no need to move forward, and the content is good. I'm thinking of buying Rom & Yeonji Bora, but I'm going to buy it after seeing this... You have a nice voice so you can concentrate well.
It looks much cleaner than before, and I like it because it seems to capture All Young's unique color well. I wanted to buy the Rom & Hanbok series because it was so pretty, but seeing this video made me want to buy more...!
A speed that doesn't have to be fast-forwarded.. I like it ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Time goes by just like this.. It's so easy to see.
It's a perfect match for bowhasa hanbok throughout! Damju Beige is a perfect name
How did you make it so mysterious and subtly?
Hey, the color is really pretty!! But the person who appeared in the video with only the lips showing no dead skin cells and the tail of the mouth is so pretty!! It's been refurbished all year round, so I hope it goes well in the future :)
I'm a man, so I don't know, but if you look closely and buy a housemate, you'll like it. Like and subscribe.
ROM&LIP is a steamed recommended item as a part-timer..!
Today, a customer asked for a recommendation, so I recommended and sold ROMN.

Wang Wang is pretty, I think the new look is more friendly and nice! Please look forward to the tips and tricks in the future!
I knew that rom and tint was good, but the package was too stingy>< Even the mask test... It's a pity I couldn't test it at the store these days, but thanks to the 'review review', I can see the formulation, durability, and color, so it's great~~ I have to go and buy it ^^
I love you always
I don't think there's anyone who doesn't have a rom & tint out of the cool tones ㅠㅠ The color is colorful, but the texture is so light and nice ㅠ In the hanbok edition, the rouge purple color is so pretty ㅠ ㅠ
I couldn't buy a lip because of the mask, but I want to buy it!
I'm using rom & tint really well, and it's nice to see it in a video like this!!
The more you use it, the more you feel it. It's a really rom & tint color and I really like the texture too.
It's a very well used item since it's settled in the fortress!!
There are so many lip products that I want to buy when I go to Olive Young, so I always do a thorough research before going, but the rom & tint was right after I tested it.
Hwaah...Yeonji Bora and Honghwa Coral are really cool...
The speed and editing are neat. The speed that Koreans like. Then I'm going to give you some money.
The most viewed tint review is a see-through matte tint, but it was also uploaded on All Young TV.
Peripera is really rare, but Romn loves cool tones!
It's also one of my favorite brands from rom & all young.
I really liked the hanbok edition back then, but the rom & cushion was good too, and this time, even the tint got through the top spot in the all-young review, right?!
What can't Rom'n do? And I really want to participate in the group giveaway event! Absolutely beautiful I will continue to support Romn and Olive Young
Wow, I can't buy it because it's pretty, the package is pretty, the color is pretty and it's not pretty, but it's not really!! If I wear a mask every day, I get annoyed because it gets on the mask. I have to run
It catches my eye
All-Young TV rather than a review app in the future!
I bought that damju beige and it's really pretty.. I was surprised that the tint color in the video was so identical to the one I did when I tried it! Haha I think it would be nice to look at the one you put together at the end when you don't have time! I think it would be nice if you could show the color development like this time while comparing the series of Clio Pro Eye Palette and 3ce 9-sphere Eye Palette in Review! I look forward to it in the future~
Subscription completed I wanted a channel like this so much hehe I think I'll be seeing it often
I also bought rom & glasting water tint at Olive Young, it's so pretty ㅠㅠ Today's rom & tint review is a very thorough and useful video.
Moya this content.... I really like it!!! The comparison colors in the review also showed color shots, so it's great... It's great because it shows a combination of honey...
All-Young... Ten days, ten days.
If this is the case, I have no choice but to go buy it.. Romanne
Doesn't stick to the mask.
Good color.
Anu@@ Olyoung Every time you bring in new content like this, every time you bring a big event, how can you not love this ㅠㅠ What's the idea of ​​reviewing a review? It's so good ️ It's a bit sad that it didn't come out today. Korean's main review! This is fat hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah Lima's voice is good and when you read the comments, your acting is so cute. And keep your mouth shut on the vertical bar detail on the left.... This is a complete all-tail
I want to take off the mask and put on a pretty tint~~~~
It's so funny Lima!! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I received the news of passing the written test today, and now I have to put on makeup for the interview, but the lip is rom & tint confirmed! Please do your best to see the interview well and come!!!!
We will continue to support the King of Olive Young!!!
I want to see a review of a lot of renewed and new cleansing products! I'll wait
The color of the rom & tint was pretty, so I wanted to try it out too, so I bought it, but it's so pretty, so I keep using it.
#OliveYoung #Rom&I'm looking forward to the reissue of a trusted brand ^^
I saw this video and bought the rom and tint right away hehe I really like the new look of Olive Young Also, in 2020, the All Alain Guide was really good, but I think it's even better this time!!! Every time I look at product reviews, there are products that I just bought and failed because they were too long and cumbersome to read. Also, I think it's really good because you can tell me a good combination of honey!! Please review a lot of various products in the future!!!
I will go again
I love the new program!!! I think it's better to do the color development together with the review!! The real colors are really pretty too. Gotta really like it!! I think it's good that it's broken down in detail!!
OMG.. who came up with the idea of ​​reviewing content? It's really fresh and I like it ㅠㅠ I look for reviews when I buy cosmetics, so I think I'll check it out often. I believe it more because I brought reviews from people who have actually used the product The All Alain Guide, which was my favorite content, is unfortunately over, but it is one of the channels that I really enjoyed subscribing to as there are many useful contents such as the quality of beauty wiki reviews. This is the best hair ever, especially Damju Beige, Purple Red, I'll pre-order it hahahaha I'll have to go to see Allyoung soon Anyway, congratulations on the new Allyoung TV and I'll always cheer for you to walk only on the flowery road. I'm sorry
The fact that it doesn't smear on the mask is really good.
ROMN is a real design restaurant, a collaboration restaurant, a product restaurant,,,,, Michelin...
Rom'n is awesome
Congratulations on your new look!
It's nice to review the review corner~^^
It's nice to see useful reviews from people who have actually used them, and to verify them right away.
This rom & tint review was steamy!
Rom'n is a god to real cool-toned people...◡̈
When I read the reviews in the app, most of the colors in the photos were not taken professionally, so I didn't know how much color or application coloration was. That was it...) This corner looks great!!
Wow wow~ I like this review♡ Watch the video in advance
If you go to Olive Young, you can do smart shopping.
By the way, the model's lips are so pretty, I want to buy all the lip tints!
I wear a mask every day, but I see..my lips ^^
Rom & Hanbok Edition is really well made..
I was debating whether or not to buy rom and tint, but I got a tint right away, thanks to the review that eliminates those worries.
Olive Young is also on YouTube. I enjoyed it.
Congratulations on the renovation of Olive Young TV!
I reviewed the review and watched the rom&see-through matte tint hanbok edition^^ I'm warm-toned so I want to buy it so I'm going to go buy it later.. I've only used rom&n lipstick, but the tint color is pretty and it doesn't stick to the mask, so I'm definitely going to buy it♡
I don't wear makeup well these days, but now I think I need to put on some makeup, so I'm going to try rom & tint!! I enjoyed "reviewing reviews" ^^ I hope you will review other products (foundation, blush, etc.) often~
Olive Young A person who cried after all the content he enjoyed on YouTube ended and was happy to review the All Young TV review. It's so good to catch all the passing information and to be able to see it at a glance.
If it's Olive Young, I think you should change the tint
Wow, I absolutely love the rom & tint. I'm going to buy it right away as soon as I get my paycheck!! The design is also very pretty and Rom & Chan
rom&see-through matte tint is my favourite❤️
Wow you came early! I bought this hanbok edition as soon as it came out, but I'm so glad it came out like this ️️️️
There are a lot of comments, but I think there are only very honest and useful information.
I'm going to listen closely.
(Something feels like fast-forwarding..? I came to check the playback speed)
Comprehensive review,
We are cheering for All Young TV
I really like the all-young refurbishment haha ​​The reviews are detailed and the colors look good so it's too tight hehe The tint is popping ㅠㅠ
All Young TV!!! Warmly welcome!!!!♡
The color is so good and it lasts...
Most of all, it doesn't stick to the mask, so it's perfect for a time like these days! I really want to try it ️
If you want to have all the colors... Is it greed? I have only one lips, but when I look at lip products, I get a slim fit...
What's up? It's new content. Take my wallet. Just take it.
If you install the All Young app, you can easily find out what's really good on sale, and you can have it delivered with Dream today when you don't have time to go All Young and even give you a coupon!!
Above all, there are so many reviews that I really like it because I can thoroughly research it and buy it!!
What's so good about this video content is that there are so many All Young reviews that it's really hard to read them all.
But how do you make rom&n so that it has such an applicability?
3CE's new nude color and damju beige are perfect,,,,, Seriously, they all cry, they even give you a pouch, so I'll try it today...
wow that's a good video
I look forward to the next one
It's a very informative video hahaha Oh, I'm just letting you know everything I'm curious about... It's so good to my ears.
It's crazy~ Comparison with the same brand product

From the color to the discount event~~~~ I will refer to it every time it is updated!
I like Rom&#39;s products because they don't have coloration~♡♡♡
I use Rom&Tint regularly, but the Rom&See-through Matte Hanbok Edition product does not stick well to the mask and the color is vivid, so it definitely looks like an upgraded tea! This is the success of All Young Magic that makes you want to buy it today!~!
I love All Young's new look~!
After changing to Olive Young All Young TV, the editing seems to be more friendly and better. Besides, it's ROMN!!! I already have two colors at home, gardenia beige and damju beige, and I love the other colors ㅠㅠ I always love you all ㅠ ️
Hey, I couldn't go this year because of Corona these days, I didn't know there was such a new thing!!!! Isn't the package really so pretty... Oh, it's so pretty that I'm mad ;; I can't do it without this package rom&!!

The name of each product goes well with the package and concept.. It's been a while since I didn't wear a lip with a mask, but it's worth buying just for collection haha ​​(++Lip model's lips are so pretty hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha)

And the video that informs the product while only narrating like this is so fresh and fun!! Contents come in quickly! (+The editing on a black background in the middle is so funny hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha) I'm looking forward to the next one
Oh, it will be very helpful for you to review ♡ Please review various products in the future! I will refer to it when purchasing ^^ Please review the eyeliner product. I always have to wipe the eyeliner under the eyes as the eyeliner smears. Are there any products that do not smudge?
Olive Young I go often with my daughters, so I hope to see you with good products in 2021, please upload a lot of good videos♡
(YouTube Subscription & Like & Alarm Setting Complete)
Liked the subscription :)
What's the color of rom&tint ㅠㅠ I like the matte formula. It doesn't smudge and it's a real life item!! I'll have to wear rom and tint again.
ㅠㅠ The product I look for the most at Olive Young is rom&, but the color I love the most is the color that I love the most. It is a rare color that is hard to find in general road shop products... I'll have to go...hehe I think I come to see Olive Young often when I have free time or because it's always in an easy-to-find place hehe I always enjoy watching Olive Young's unique content on YouTube. As a subscriber to Chego Yam All Young TV, I watch the video from start to finish and always comment on it hahahaha I found this video the most interesting among the recently uploaded videos! I love it so much..I love it. I really like the voice of the person who dubbed this video. It's bright and calm, so it's the best!! So I want to recommend a new content to All Young TV... How about asmr content in the wall?!??! Olive Young There are a lot of food items among the brand products in the store, so I think it would be perfect for asmr hahaha I always love Olive Young...

[Review the review~!!]
#All::OliveYoung Now review to review
#Lee::This is my item that can't leave Olive Young
Reviewing reviews! How can you be so new ♡ Show All Young Sense
From the design to the formulation to the reviews using the reviews, I was sold today as well.
I'm going to go write a review today, hoping that someday my review will also appear on All Young TV.
The rom and tint color is really pretty.
Busy, busy, the best speed in modern society Yeonji Bora I really need to buy this right now ㅠㅠ I was contemplating whether to buy this or not, but this content ended my worries ️
I've only tried Rom&Zero Velvet Tint and not see-through matte, but after seeing the color shots of Yeonji-Bora, I immediately understood why everyone is rommen. It's fun to review the reviews and let me know all the pros and cons of the content.
It is more reliable because it shows color development and texture based on actual reviews.
The rom & lip product is steamy... The color of rosy purple is so pretty ㅠㅠ It's not drying and it's soft, so it's good to use in winter too. I'm going to buy another color right away!! There are 4 of them, they're really pretty!
Gulgu Lily by Red Cheek Liar Coating Tint Review!
Also, when buying cosmetics, Olive Young
The color that you can't buy from Rom'n's new releases...John Ye Tanguri.. Look at the rouge in the hanbok edition. It's a very pretty color that can't be found easily.
Take off your voice and put on your panties!!!
When the hanbok edition first came out, I only saw the packaging and said it was really pretty, but even the colors are so diverse,,,,
Isn't that something only rom&n can do? It's hard to find a cool tone lip, so I only apply the same lip every time.
I found Rom&.. Cool tone colors are very diverse, so I'm happy with cool tones.
What is the durability?
I think everyone will like the color, but when you actually try to find it, you choose a color that is hard to find, and the coloration is not too deep, but it has a long lasting power that doesn't stick to the mask...!
should buy this
After knowing the Olive Young channel, the staff also explained in detail reviews and relieved me of the worries of purchasing the product that suits me at All Young.
When it came out as a new rom & hanbok edition, I saw the color development and released a lip color that matches the hanbok.
Among the glazing tints, Nudie Peanut, especially rich coral, has become the life color of the glazing tint. It goes well with the coral color, so I want to try damju beige. It's a pretty color to layer alone.
I wanted to buy a tint that doesn't stick to the mask, but I decided on rom & see-through matte tint...
God Rom &.. God All Young.. I need to go buy it right now!!
rom and design is so pretty
I also like the tint color.
I'm looking forward to rom and tint
For me as a cool-toned person, ROM&N is a ray of light...☆ Please review the following reviews with products containing cica ingredients :D
That and that... I was trying to live in Damju.
Sold out ... It's really pretty, but I ended up buying another one ..... Next time...! Live hahaha ... And how pretty is that unnie's lips?? Wow, you look like a real princess.
Lip products that you must step on when you go to All Young
The rom&lip tint has a soft finish and is not heavy, so it has good coloring power even when applied thinly, has good color development, and doesn't stick to the mask, so it's really cool

The part of makeup that I really care about the most is lip makeup, so I am a person who looks sick if I don't apply lip. I always carry lip tint with me.
Reviews are especially important for cosmetics, but Olive Young has a lot of reliable reviews, so I use it a lot!! Reviewing the review Corner Now, I'll keep my eyes wide open every night and watch~~~ Yesterday I got a tint too, after seeing this, I'm going to go buy another rom & tint.
I love this so much!! If you recommend All Young TV, go for it!!
2 2 2
After all, the magic that makes you open your wallet! As soon as I saw it, I went to buy it! I think it's so pretty
The color of the rom & hanbok edition is so pretty and I want to buy all the see-through matte tint colors~~ rom & cool tone products are so diverse and i love it so much~~<
Oh I'm back!!
Hey, it's Olive Young who always goes in and out like my house to look around and buy things, so reviewing reviews !! I think I will buy a lot of better products usefully in the future!! By the way, why is Rom&Tint so pretty.. You worked hard!! hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha novo de novo

Always trust and watch the Olive Young channel! Since it's a new Rom&n, you can't afford not to buy it!
As soon as I saw this, I was sold like I was possessed.. I love Romanne, I love Olive Young.
All Young TV [Review the review] Connor
<Rom&> see-through matte tint hanbok edition
It's a great corner for shoppers with indecisiveness like me
I got pocket money and I live right away!!! I buy rom & once a month, so my heart is at ease lol
I read the Olive Young No. 1 tint review collection.
extract collection

I wish you all the best in 2021.
I've heard a lot of good things about rom and tint, but none of them exist ㅠㅠ I'll have to buy one.
All-young's new look is pretty, and the rom & lip is pretty hehe
Subscription completed I often buy royal secret book eye lotion from Olive Young
I've never used Rom'n before, but it's New Year's Day, so it's a hanbok house, so the colors are so pretty. I also recommend daily items and support everyone~ I definitely want to try the warm tone Rom & products!!!!
I'm looking forward to rom and tint
It is difficult to apply tint because it is a state of affairs, but because of wearing a mask, I think I can understand why it is famous...! There is no pink coloring, the cool tone color is so pretty ㅠㅅㅠ Isn't the hanbok edition especially pretty??! I'll go ahead and buy it soon too.
The shape of the lips is also very pretty. I'm really envious
Rom & Hanbok Series John Ye...
Because of the best reviewers, my bankbook is getting more and more see-through.. It's like Rohm and Tint's package.. ★ Do you know how I feel? I want them all.... I have a collection certificate ( ˃̣̣̥᷄⌓˂̣̣̥᷅ )
It's the color I want, as expected rommen~
Detailed reviews are very helpful when purchasing a product.
This Yoo I like Olive Young ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………
Thanks for the always good information!
Wow, the rom & matte tint is really thick...
Rohm and Tint is the best
I have been very interested in beauty products since I was paired, so while shopping at Olive Young, Rom&#39;s products caught my eye!
I have a cool summer tone, so it wasn't easy to find a color that matches my tone, but I think rom&n has a lot of cool tones without needing to be fussy, so I think it's great!

In particular, the colors of dried willow flowers and dried buckwheat flowers for my shadow were very pretty, and for the tint, pig pig and fizz were the colors of my life. I had to go, so I was looking for a matte tint, but it's full of sense.
After seeing it, I wanted to buy it.... (Reservation)
Olive Young's new makeover was a huge success haha ​​It's neat
I'm using two rom & tints!! ️ Absolutely great! Rom and tint that I like as it is soft
All-young is the best! Now, this Sunday and Sunday, I was thinking about what to buy for tint at All Young, but I'm going to try the rom & see-through matte tint!
so pretty ♡♡
What if you collect reviews?
Don't skip my top reviewer seat!!!
Olive young is the best, my two daughters love it.
She was debating whether or not to buy jahuang red, but I have to go and buy Olive Young right away!!
Wow. It's so nice to review the review!! Really the king of reviews....
It's so luxurious... it's brilliant
I'm looking forward to rom and tint
Wow^*^Now with All Young TV, my favorite rom & brand ♡
It's great that you interpret the review><♡As expected, all young!!
I tried lip and tried rom & hanbok tint, but I put it in my shopping cart
I put it back and postponed the purchase, but I'll have to buy it this time :^* I really like the summary of All Young reviews!!! It would be nice if you could review the cushions separately ♡ The price is not cheap, so I bought it without trying it, so I want to buy it after seeing detailed reviews, but it is difficult to make a purchase decision based on the reviews posted.
Hue restaurant.. Rom&Sreungh..
It is the most purchased and favorite brand in ROMN, but the brand that I buy the most is because of its good cost-effectiveness and frequent sales!! When I go to All Young, the first thing I go to is rom&. The colors are so good and I love the variety of different formulations.
Oh? When did the name change to All Young TV...? I came here because I was surprised when the alarm went off... I really like the detailed color display and honest reviews, but the real video is better than the text... Her lips are so pretty that it looks so good... ㅠㅠ
I like the new look of All Young
rom and love ♡
Review the review and look forward to the future
From the start, rom&review is so good
rom&damju beige doesn't suit me, but rom&brick cover looks good. What color is it??
Hull Rom & Hanbok Edition .. and who is the real designer of the colors ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm also thinking about how long it will last, but if you upload a video like this, I'll run right away..
Tint restaurant rom&,, I like the detailed review
Reviews are really useful.
All of the rom and colors are so pretty.
This is the best tint! ️️️
People who haven't tried Rom'n don't feel sorry for it keke I really like the hanbok edition
The title of the review is really good.
It's a rom & tint with the best color development, so I couldn't help but look at it.
I love the safflower coral color.
I want to run to Allyoung right now.
I love you Olive Young
Wow, I think all the colors of Rom & Hue products are so pretty! I have a desire to buy it! Hehe I don’t even have to wear makeup these days, but I want to buy it. There are many high-quality, pretty highlighters in Olive Young.
Rom and Tint is awesome....!
Wow 95% of the tints in the house are rom & tint, but I love rom n
I can't tell you about rom&n's product power... and the colors are good again... my favorite brand, rom&, comes out with a tint in a pretty package like this, stimulating the desire to collect...? In particular, the safflower coral is perfect, so the wallet is already open.
The tint is perfect.
Moyamoya, thank you so much for hosting an event like this. Rom&See-through Matte Tint The color is really pretty, the application is good, and the coloration is also good.
This meticulous review is love.
Rom'n is also a Hue restaurant..
Glasting Water Tint Gardenia Beige, if it’s spring warm, definitely buy it....️ If you apply Gardenia Beige on Damju Beige Base, you will die.
The rom & tint's lasting power is too short ㅠ It disappears quickly
I'm happy with the safflower coral and rouge purple that I'm wearing here and there. Wow, but the design taste is the best. Actually, rom & glazing water tint doesn't smear more than rom & zero velvet, so it doesn't show moisture. Actually, Zero Velvet has color or wrinkles. It glides on pretty well, but it bleeds too hard. The color is still pretty, so I couldn't give up, but you guide me to buy this. It's a lot easier to see than most reviews, and now it's more objective than personal opinions. I think it's a very good part for that. You're all working hard..♡
Very pretty color ㅠㅠ
Room& is pretty. The bungee velvet is moist and matte :) There are a lot of reviews.. I think safflower coral is the prettiest. It is good because it is a product that expresses the feeling of hanbok and goes well with it, so you can use it even if your face is not white.
I'm going to go all-young tomorrow and buy Damju Beige and Jahwang Red... lol lol
Also Olive Young
Romanne It's really amazing now. How can you get such a product in such a package... Even the name is pretty, Damju Beige Safflower Coral, Purple Red, Yeonji Bora, Thank you for the honey combination. It's so pretty. Plus a discount? I believe rom-men
Please create an atmosphere where men are not shy even if they go alone.
hello! I'm an only all-younger!! In particular, I have been using Avene products for a really long time. If you have a chance, please review Avene Trixera Lotion, Sun Mineral Cream, and Cicalpart Plus s.o.s Cream!! Lima please!
I didn't know if it was warm or cool, so I was looking for coral pink lip. What safflower red? I love matte lip, but I always struggled with dead skin cells and wrinkles, but I think this hanbok edition can be used without any worries! I take care of my lips in a cup of anti-inflammatory and when I forget to sleep, I must buy that tint and try it!! It's really ️️every time I ask, it's strangely reluctant to use it again even after a brief visit, but if it's close to Inje, I'll have to use it twice. I really like it. For me, who puts a lot in my mouth and eats it, I am very welcome that it has good durability. The videos were very long and there were a lot of chatter, so it was hard to watch, but I really liked that Yogi picked up only the core and showed the reviews. I will review the review and look forward to many good and useful videos in the future!!
lukewarm cool's eyes lit up at #8...
#AllYoungTV review review and launch It's really groundbreaking!
I spend a lot of time searching the internet for where and how to find other people's reviews when choosing a product.
It's the ultimate in convenience to be able to see other users' reviews of ROM&products in one video like this +_+
The rom&hanbok edition seems to be a tint of elegant yet intense colors with a pastel-toned design, but it is a strong product that does not come off on the mask.
Thank you for watching the best review video of All Young
Thank you for helping me a lot to choose the right product for me ^^
All Young TV ~ As always, many people find it with a happy heart.

I support you to receive warm love ^^
It's a tint with all the rom & color development.
Yeonji Bora is the coolest..
The tints are so pretty.
When it comes to rom and tint, it's a cool tone formula.
But can't you get warm tone colors?!
It is said that both non-nob warm tones and cool tones are well extracted.
Hanbok edition pattern + message (natural beauty)
As soon as the alarm went off, I came here to watch all the videos hehe After remodeling All Young TV, aren't you doing a great job?! The voice and the diction fit well too, but the model's lips are so pretty too. Wannabe Lip..!! And above all, the color development seems to come out exactly without correction, so I think it would be good to watch it again two or three times and decide on the tint color. I think it will be of great help! Looking forward to other content in the future.
A detailed review of each will be very helpful
I'm thinking about which color to buy
Don't be stressed because of decision-making disorder.
I can buy it thank you
My lips are dry, so I can't get my hands on matte tint. So I'm using the same series of water tint Omija Red, but Damju Beige is crazy??? “Why don’t you buy Galworm…?” If I don't buy it after seeing this review, I think it's cheating, so I'm going to buy it right now...

It's the same when buying any other product, but I think I get to see more reviews on cosmetics. I spend a lot of time reading and referencing them carefully, but they recommend these good cosmetics and read reviews at a rate that Koreans will like ㅜㅜ I just listen comfortably It's so nice to be able to do it~~ I will use it often in the future!!
Wow, it looks like the atmosphere has become brighter and brighter after the all-young redecoration! This new content is also great..!!! It's disgusting to review a review. The clever idea of ​​All-Young's planning ability + a simple and clean screen + a review with warm and cool tones + an introduction to realistically disappointing points + the amount and speed of video suitable for a busy modern society. !
I think rom and tint will be used over and over again once you use them. But I like it more because the color development, durability, smearing, and coloring are all good.
I don't need it all, I love Olive Young
I have safflower coral, but it's sad that there are no reviews ㅠㅠ I'm a nuclear zone wise person,,,,,, buy the mute people,,,,, the atmosphere is subtle and beautiful.. Reviewing reviews...! I always read reviews carefully, but I was so moved by this content that only the necessary information and one product were summarized in detail. ! After seeing this, I even thought that I wanted to share honey information by writing a review.


... I will cheer for the renewed All Young TV too.
I had a lot of fun with the helpful tips video!
Review Master's Banggabangga^^♡ I'm so glad to recommend Rom&Tint~ Who is the department store lipstick company these days? Rom& is all you need. Am I the only one like that?
Congrats on the launch by reviewing AllYoung TV & Review!
After all, if you tint, Romn
I am completely hit by the warm-toned human damju beige.
I think I'll have to go get it right away.
I think this is the best product that doesn't stick to the mask.
Participation complete!
Congratulations on all-young's new makeoverʕ•ﻌ•ʔ ♡
Allyoung's new look, I praise you for the new review
Wow, I'm really looking forward to the new refurbishment. I'm looking forward to buying them all. I'm going to go shopping for Olive Young this afternoon~~♡
romane is really pretty
I'm on Instagram lately. If I say I'm interested in cosmetics~^^ It seems like I'm using it all. First of all, the concept on the package or on the website makes me want to buy it. The texture and color are really soft on the lips, and I really like that the color is a little different from other road shops.
The color is really pretty
Isn't the tint rom n? I tried Rom&Water Resting Tint and liked Rom&Brend. As for the tint, Rom'n is the best. It's a restaurant~ In the meantime, it's a matte tint zone haha
I think I did a good job using the rom and water tint.. as expected.. the best
The lips are thin and the face color is neither black nor white, yellow, and the personal came out in a warm tone. What kind of lip should I use?..
Ever since ROMN came to Olive Young, every day sparrows go in like a mill and buy one each.
A list of warm tone tints I made to buy.
ROMN - 07 Damju Beige
ROMN - Honghwa Coral
Wow, the newly-renovated All-Young TV...Everyone likes the subscription, don't they?!?!? To those of you who have completely learned to come back with the tint review video of Rom'n's Hanbok Edition at the same time as the renovation...^^Rom'n's tint is really the best ㅜㅜ It has a matte texture and is soft with no flaking of dead skin cells!!!♡Besides, why is it that the colors are so well drawn TTTT From now on, Olive Young and Romanne...forever ♡♡♡I'm going to be called a real nickname. Why yum Olive Young Sparrow. ..I can't get past Olive Young, not a mill, so hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Homt is emerging as a substitute!!! I want all-young product contents to help Homt haha
Wow nice review
So good
Rom&Hanbok is great!
It is the only store where a man is not shy or awkward even if he visits alone *^^* Only All Young will go!!!
so pretty ️
Wow no color
Review the review, the idea is really good ㅠㅠ You know this is a lot of work and Rohm and Tint came out after seeing this ㅠㅠ What a Hanbok Edition?!?!? Olive young will pop out to pay right away.. =333
The rom & color is crazy, it's so pretty
All of the rom and tint colors are the best...
Good sense of opening date
Take off your voice and run your panties lol
I think it's good content because it gives you the feeling that you can see the information at a glance by putting it all together!!
Even if you wear a mask, lips are absolutely essential, but the best thing is that you don't ask!! Buy now><
I love you olive
Hoek ︎ Review Master ㅠㅠ It's great that you review reviews! The Rom&Hanbok Edition is so pretty.. The package that appeared for the Lunar New Year... As expected, it's a K-beauty mulberry tea ︎ I'll have to run with Olive Young
Tint is nice!
All-Young's new look is so good. It's easy to access, so I'll be looking for it often hehe The tints are so pretty! Olive Young, I encourage you to walk only on the flower path in the future and keep winning ♡♡
ROM&N's exterior design is crazy. It wouldn't be easy to implement the hanbok color, and it's true that you don't ask even if you wear a mask. Is it a true story...? Boso who understands the needs of consumers well is also the undisputed number one All-Young.
Please restock Yeonji Bora.
The review is very thorough, but it's not boring at all, and the speed Koreans want...
Because there are many products in All Young stores, it was cumbersome and difficult to search for reviews every time before buying, but please [review reviews] a lot!! ️
Subscribe as soon as you see it
Without Olive Young, the Korean beauty industry would have died!
Sincere congratulations on the new renovation of Olive Young.
I hope to receive love and interest from more and more people!
I really enjoyed the Olive Young No. 1 tint review collection and I want to give it to my girlfriend as a gift~!
This is Rom'n's girlfriend's favorite!
Cosmetics are trendy so it's hard to keep up with them.
Is the lip red after all? NO~NO~~Not all reds are the same! Go Olive Young with a card today!
It's perfect for a gift!
All the colors are so pretty it's hard to choose
buy now
Oh.. you're going to make it blank again..
Anyone who knows what the color of the first thumbnail is, you know...
I didn't buy tint because of Corona.
should i buy again
I will go all year
Welcome to All Young TV
Rom&Tint is King Jung.
They say that the mask doesn't get on...????????
The safflower coral color is pretty. I'm going to go all-young!!
I want to gift it to my wife!!
When it comes to tinting, it's rom&.
Was the chili that bright?
Like comment subscribe!! bang bang!!
all young
Meanwhile, I envy the corners of my lips
All Young TV Review Wow
The timeline is a pity, the start doesn't match
great !
tell me how much
Are you running to Olive Young without you knowing?
It's fast, it's fast hahaha
John Jam Thrurin
I'm very curious.. What tone do I have that safflower coral suits me well..? TT Orange doesn't suit me, I don't really like pink at all.. It suits a slightly dried rose color, and I really don't like purple...

I like Damju Beige
rom and dope
3:16
Hmm.. no matter how you look at it, it smells like event manipulation...
Hey, I'm a boy and I want to write that.
Damju Beige Safflower Coral Purple Purple Red
good review
Take off! Put on your panties!!
Wow!! panties!!!(?)
How much is this??????????????
It's brilliant....

The lips are too heavy.
O
good review
=========End of Crawling===========
The person who planned it is really cool..
It feels like an amusement park and I want to go right away ㅠㅠ All Young Sale I'm going=333
Because it's a witch in the witch factory, mirror room + levitation = honor ㅠㅠ
It's the last all-young sale this year, so it's a fantastic parade!
The All Young Sale is the last of this year.. I have to decorate the end of the year with All Young Celltem Flex splendidly.
wow great! The sale is pouring hahahahahahaha
Oh, the Mediheal mask pack is made with balloons, so it looks rich and pretty ㅠㅠ All young sale advertisement that you can trust and watch 👍
Crazy Weme Palette Tint and Special Set... Buy Now
I went today and brought a bunch of packs.
Very happy 💕
The Clio cushion is so real ㅋㅋ At the moment, I thought it was a real Ferris wheel. 🎡
You must use Olive Young for events!!
When I saw the video, my heart fluttered... ❣
Last time on the last day, I thought I should go, but I missed it.. This time, I have to go pick it up! Go~!
Mmm.. Mersett.. All-Young went all-in on the sale because it’s the last of this year~
The video is so pretty 💚💚💚💚 After watching the small screen on Instagram, I wanted to see the pretty things big, so I came to YouTube and saw it. Run to the All Young Sale 💚💚💚💚💎💎💎🎀🎀🎀
I bought it last week ㅠㅠ I think I'll have to go rob it one more time to stock up in advance ;;
Hey, you're so pretty when you first came out..
The person who planned it, the sale is pouring in.
Scale Merseon 129...I needed a firming cream this winter...Is it there...I...a place to go...!!!!'ㅁ'
Monde cf so cute🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️❤️❤️❤️
I like the sale
I couldn't buy the ISO because it was expensive, but I'll have to buy one this time..
Are you giving away tints on the Jamman palette?
this has to go
I saw this and bought Dr.G Soothing Cream lol
Wow, you should get it all next week
He said he bought a serum before, but there is also a cream, but seeing this makes me want to buy it.
The All Young Sale is settling down a bit.. It settles in my heart ✨
Anyone know the background music? Just listening to the song makes me excited and happy 😆
When I saw the isoi serum, it was expensive.
Five years ago, it was 2-3 million won.
It's 8 million now
When an advertisement appears in the middle of a video, the sound is a little loud
Why do I remember Younghee from the squid game?
Isn't it crazy racing world?
Your voice is similar to that of View Ma haha
Is it the Gyeongju World background??
=========End of Crawling===========
The first time I saw Cococho unnie was because of her eyelashes, but she is recognized as an eyelash craftsman.
Finally, eyelashes♡ I will prepare diligently and follow Cococho's eyelashes.
I realized why my eyelashes couldn't curl nicely.
Now, thanks to All Young, dazzling eyelashes are completely possible.
Cococho = Eyelash tip craftsman..TT If you search for a curler or eyelashes, you can find the first instructor, Cococho. I watched the video for 4 weeks. Olive Young will wait for the next content soon.
Absolutely great tip! My eyelashes are so weak that I fall out every time I put on makeup, so I don't do well. I want to follow the makeup method that Cococho taught me
You are so pretty ㅠㅠ I really want to become an eye makeup expert
I'm really envious of the hand technique ㅠ ㅠ I haven't tried it because I'm afraid of ironing it, but I'll have to try it someday....
I've already seen it in Cococho's video, but ,,, ㅠㅇㅠ Really, I don't know if I can listen to the advanced technology for free at a makeup shop like this in Cheongdam-dong, uhhhhh, thank you very much ㅠ Very Mimi Juju Barbie Practice until you get all the doll eyes I will!!
Check-out is complete today! I didn't have thin eyelashes, so I just gave up mascara and lived.. I'll try idol eyelashes with Cococho's recommended item!!
It was very difficult to create eyelashes, but thank you for letting me know.
Check-out complete!!! I was so looking forward to the inner eye ㅆw episode TTTTTTTTTT I'm going to replay the real eyelash tutorial twice,,, ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
This is a really helpful tip! I'll have to try it too! ^^
Wow great eyelash tips, take a good look
This is a really good tip. I'll try my best to follow it ^^*
Does the use of the viewer used in the video affect the durability?
Kokocho's eyelashes look like Barbie dolls•• Very Yeven•••
Also a tip
Thanks for the tip today
Cococho, it's already been 4 weeks haha ​​I've been watching you from the beginning haha
The viewer is really good
Can you give me some cardigan information?
and good

Thank you for the information ♡♡
Equipment sucks for beginners!
I prepared the same thing as Cococho.
But it is a step that requires much more elaborate work than I thought.
I can't even go out on the weekend ㅠㅠ
I want to try it
It's not easy at all for a noob like me...
By the way, is there any reason to use a curling iron instead of using an eyelash curler?????
Oh, there is a wood for skewers, you can cut it out and use it haha ​​I’ll put it on one by one and put it on, then put it on and try it tomorrow.
Can I know the information about the lenses that Cococho is wearing? :)
My eyelashes are very long, but because of my eyebrows, even if my eyelashes went up perfectly, they drooped immediately after a while, so I was very annoyed.
I want to meet Chungha on the beauty wiki. The eyelashes reminded me of Chungha somehow, and I want to meet you in a healthy way after hearing that you have been diagnosed with Corona this time.
I wonder which tweezers you used!!
Wow, I'm a person who hears that I extended mascara, but I've never seen a curler anywhere, but I've been doing it like this.
Wow great tip hahaha
These are the products I have, I'll give it a try!
My phone is out, but now I'm out.
I'm learning well today too.
Please give me the cardigan information, it's so pretty
full benefit
The clothes shown here are cardigans sold by Rocoming..!
The cardigan is so pretty.. It suits you well where is it?
I'm curious about cat eyelashes
What to bring: Long eyelashes
How do you do the viewer like that?
ah! Bulgode was done after mascara.
Where can I get a tweezer like that?
How about Twizer?
How about tweezer..
Everyone, Tweezers are supposed to be Benefit!!
Preparation 0. Long, pretty eyelashes like a doll...
(I fail...... )
Just looking at the thumbnail, I thought it was commentary
After lashes are thin.. ㅠ
It looks just like the penthouse commentary
や
May I know where the tongs pin is? ??
Hello Lensmer
You look like Joo-Kyung
You look like Seo In-young
0:39
When are you doing that?
One
=========End of Crawling===========
Your voice is so good Testimonials...so pretty
1 day 1 all young... The real tanky combination is love ㅠㅠ
Tanky's name is Kim Tae-yeon, Kim Ki-beom...
Taeyeon bursting with beauty potential.. so pretty
Ha ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I had a lot of trouble to endure while respecting this to see it myself ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I love you Kim Taeyeon Kim Kibeom ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Tango is so pretty and Kibum is so handsome
Aww, both are pretty
Wow, really tango is so pretty ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Tanky TTTTTTTT
Taeyeon's height.. Olive Young's eyes are just a fantasy
0:10 Oh taenggoo is so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
The two narrated voices are so good together.. I'm going crazy. I really like it...
It really is a very wise and excellent model choice. It is contrasted with the theme of going or turning on a tanky, which is really perfect for the topic of management in daily life, but flows in the same way, keeping the theme of the advertisement and without losing the subjectivity of the model. Anyway, I love it so much, I believe it's not a one-time thing.
Be with Tanky forever Olive Young
The perfect combination of quitangu...️ I can't help but love it...
KEY LOOKS REALLY AMAZING
I really like their looks and their voices, it's the best combination ️
I give myself five hundred times to Olive Young, who uses it as a model for the Tanky Siblings.... I hope Olive Young and the Tanky Siblings last a long time.
Taeyeon is so perfect
Damn it, brother and sister tanky
Oh really, Olyoung is really, really, really good at her job ㅠㅠㅠㅠ A perfect model like this!!!
Both tankies came out so pretty ㅠㅠ♡
Oh crazy, so pretty, how can an advertisement come out like a pictorial ㅠㅠ Olive Young and model Tanky go so well together ♡♡
As expected, Olive Young...Thank you ㅠㅠTT The tanky combination is a word.it.not.
Who doesn't know the tank combination... I feel so happy every time I watch TV.
I love Olive Young. The tanky model is really the best choice.. I will continue to use Olive Young ❛˓◞˂̵✧
Taeyeon is so pretty
Seeing it posted a week ago now ㅠㅠ I really like the tanky combination ㅠㅠ
No, seriously, even if you want to go to another store, how do you go somewhere else after seeing Tanky's beauty, I can't do that, I don't know how to do it, trust Tanky, a great face genius, let's see Olive Young
Tanky's voice is soft and rustic ㅠㅠ It's perfect!!! I love it all, I need to use it more
I am in the room and when I hear the sound of “Our routine” on the TV in the living room, I immediately run out.. It’s good to see it as much as it is ️‍ It’s the first time I’ve seen an advertisement .. The combination of models fits really well and I like the person’s picture. That's what it feels like to be in Olive Young. There are a lot of songs for our tangoo and Kibum in Olive Young, so it's so great that we can listen to other people too, and above all, especially!! We feel that Bonnie & Clyde likes it, so more and more!! Like, please renew the contract. I will go to Olive Young a lot.
I like the key combination with Taeyeon
I look forward to many good videos and events
Tango, take the lead! Purchasing Routine Gazzah!!
Both narration voices are so good... really so pretty
Because Tanky is a model, I really want to buy it ㅠㅠ It was Sparrow 1 that I couldn’t just pass by this year, but I’m so happy that there are fellow sparrows.
15s and 30s are not enough
A video that makes you happy just looking at your face
Olive young go on or on
Both of them are so pretty, maybe it's good.
I really like Taeyeon Kibum and Olive Young ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
The best TTTT I have to go to Olive Young today haha
The Tanky Siblings are advertising for Olive Young ㅠㅠ I'll check them out every day.
Really so pretty and handsome
I love their chemistry. And Key's skin ... sigh
You have the best voice, really cute and the best advertising model!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
their skins are incredible wow
It's really perfect for All Young commercials ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Bonnie & Clyde is really creepy, amazing
‘Come here, this is Olliboo’!!!!

=========End of Crawling===========
Why did I know now that Allyoung has an official channel? It's very useful to briefly and simply summarize in one video without the hassle of going to the detail page of a lot of cosmetics and scrolling back and forth. I'm using a pencil liner like that, and I want to try it out because I don't think there will be any problem with a more natural and sharp drawing with a pencil liner that is that thin.

! I'll set an alarm and wait for the next video
Because Olive Young ranks it like this every time, I think it's good to see more trendy (?) products than the All Young website! Especially since I don't have a pencil liner, I was thinking about what to buy. Thank you.
Actually, I've never done eyeliner before, so I want to try it, but after watching the video, I thought I wanted to draw Ara as soon as possible ㅠㅠ It looks like it's drawn very smoothly.
I used to only use a brush pen eyeliner every day, but these days, I naturally wanted to use a pencil eyeliner, so I was looking for it, and this video came up and was really helpful. , 2nd, 3rd place...hehe Thanks to you, now I have made up my mind!! Thanks for the good video Olive Young
I tested it at All Young and my style was Clio :)
But seeing the detailed tests like this, I really like Merge...!!
Even though it's a recommended video, I'm completely drawn to the video production.
He is the mastermind of Mudge's hot fan who believes in the miracle of only 6 dollars TTTTTTTTTT The price is really good, but the product quality of the expensive product is never lost.... I felt that the event was held more often than other products, which would be especially good for students. so nice,,,,,
Let's all hold on to Starbucks once in a while and go buy Mudgee eyeliner ~~~
It's been a while since I've seen the All-Alain Guide, but it's hard to pick only the topics I like...
I just finished using the eyeliner, but the fact that you uploaded a video like this is the best of all Alain Guide.
It's great that you even did a smear test!!!
Enter the app to order Clio.
The pencil was always smudged so I didn't use it, but Clio!! That's great. I'm learning a tip today that the pencil can also be used as a liner and can be used like a shadow by smudging~ I'm learning makeup on the Olive Young channel haha
All Alain Guide is the best ㅜㅜ I'm a newbie who started makeup late, so I didn't know which eyeliner to buy, but today! I knew it after watching the All Alain Guide, I love you
In the past, I only used a brush pen, so I always had panda eyes, but when I used a pencil type, it was definitely less smudged~~ There are a lot of good-quality eyeliner at a good price, so I really like it ㅠㅠ
All Alain Guide is really the best!
I have a little bit of eyeliner smearing well.
I'm that type of person, so always eyeliner ♡
I was worried whether I should buy it or not, but please show me another good one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's been a long time since I've seen Sammy and Uni-nim as an all-alin guide, so I'm so so so happy~~
I also use the brown eyeliner color, but the natural brown color is also popular.
I still needed almost all of the eyeliner product, but thank you for showing it in this Olive Young All-All-In-One video!
Since Clio is so famous, I repurchased and used only the Clio So Simple Liner every time.
Thank you for showing us other good products and colors.
Nice to buy!
Yesterday, I also bought the Tone Up Cream from Olive Young Nine Wishes Live.
Still, I was just using a brush pen liner and was about to change it to a pencil liner, but they gave me a good pencil liner and color on the back of my hand to tell me the popularity rankings ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm buying it right away!
It's so cool to review unnies.
It was recommended by the Clio staff, so I wrote it.
At first, I was embarrassed because it was thin.
It's good to draw in detail, and it doesn't smudge.
Great! The staff is also very good.
The real Clio waterproof pencil eyeliner is a staple hahaha It's thin so I use it quickly, but it doesn't smudge too much, the color is pretty, and my favorite ️ Also, Olive Young, next time I'll do a glitter version!!!
I'm a beginner at drawing eyeliner, so I bought the merged eyeliner which was easy to draw and had a good reputation, but it never smeared even though I have matchless and oily skin.
Omo omo,,,, I thought there was going to be a Clio pencil liner, but I'm really happy to be facing the first place hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha My mother was the reason I came into contact with it, so I will have to pick up a lot during the all-young sale ️️
Looking at the All-Alain Guide, I feel like I'm buying it every day. Uhhhhhhhhh.. it's really my favorite item.. I guess I'm not the only one who thinks it's good hahaha It's really cost effective.
It's an all-young sale, so I want to buy and try Lil Barre's products too.
I only use mascara because Ara keeps spreading, but seeing Ara that doesn't smear makes me want to use it again! Thank you Olive Young for making a useful video. Today's video was fun! Even if I don't win, I definitely want to buy one of those three ^♡^
I thought that the pencil liner spreads well and is thick, but there are such good items... Thank you for the good information!
Hey, I'm so glad my product came out!! I'm really crazy about using Clio...it really doesn't smudge at all. It's cheap and it's just moderately thin, so it's really good when you take off the eyebrows.
Merge is really cheap, but it didn't smudge, so I was surprised, but there was a slim version ㅠㅠ I'm curious about Lil Barre too. I love All Alain.
(There was an All-Young sale, so I went and bought a kill cover cushion. Do you have any plans for an All-Alain cushion version?)
As expected, I thought there would be Clio hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I want to try it because it's classy. And since the merge liner is slim, I want to try using the merge too! I want to use it all.. You hold great events every time, so I always participate without hesitation.. Thank you for the good information.
I couldn't see the All Alain guide.... Why did I buy the eyeliner? Alain Guide
Clio eyeliner is hard to tell ㅠㅠ It's really easy to draw long lasting armor and it's awesome!! After watching today's video, I want to try Mudge and Lily by Red eyeliner too!!! I want to try the durability and oiliness test myself hehehe
Real eyeliner finalizer is here!!!!
Even today, I'm going to go all-young right now and buy it~~~
Since Clio is incomparable and has some flesh on the eyelids, it is an item that introduced me as a pencil eyeliner to me, who used to only use a brush pen in the first place.. It draws quickly, but if I fix it, it does not smudge even once and the powder does not fall off and it is good. I've heard a lot of good things about the other two products, but I'll have to try them out!
The eyeliner spreads every day in 30 seconds and I ate the eyeliner because it was double eyelids. I am a nomadic eyeliner, but I was really worried about whether or not to test and buy the 2nd and 3rd place every day, but I settled on the 1st place, Clio Sharp So Simple. You really have to pick it up when it's on sale.
I buy Clio eyeliner every time, and I've tried various colors of dark brown, cacao brown, and brown, but it's always just perfect!!! I love clio eyeliner
Hey, I'm an idiot who can't draw eyeliner like dog shit, but thanks to the algorithm, I'm passing on some tips ️ Clio also subscribed to the All Alain Guide
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Lily by Red For me, I am using walnut brown because black is too burdensome, but it goes on smoothly and doesn't come off easily, so I'm using it really well! It becomes lumpy with use, so it is difficult to apply it thinner than when I first used it, but after using it, I got used to it.
I'm using Clio well, but I saw it in a video like this!! Today, I feel proud on All Young Channel.
thanks for the good info
Clio, Lilvare, Weme, Merge.. I tried all of them, but the best one is God Clio, which never smudges and is so thin that it lasts well.. ㅠㅠ Weme is
It's a brush pen, so it stings a little on my eyes, but it's long lasting and doesn't smudge, so it's in 2nd place.. it doesn't smear, but why doesn't it last well in my eyes.. 3rd place.. Lil Barre does smear in my eyes and it doesn't last long. ..why is it only in my eyes... ㅠㅠ
Hull tint restaurant Lilvarega Ara is crazy
Merge liner is now my life's item haha. The price is crazy and above all, the color is so pretty. I remember losing it at school because it was too small.. Haha I really need to try the Clio liner ️
Really, thank you so much for giving me a lot of great tips and introducing only really good things.
I know good eyeliner well and I needed eyeliner. Thank you for the good video every time.
I used to only use a brush pen eyeliner because I was afraid the pencil eyeliner would smudge, but after seeing this video, I felt that I wanted to try the pencil eyeliner. Clio is so famous that I tried it every time I went to Olive Young, but what I drew on the back of my hand didn’t come off until I got home and washed my hands. I also enjoyed today's video
I was just buying the eyeliner because I only knew about Kiss Me, so I was just buying it because it was a burden, but I'm glad I found other honey items.
I know that Clio and Lily by Red eyeliner are good, so I tried them, and I'm in 1st and 3rd place, so I feel proud of myself hahaha I knew that the merged lip was good, but the eyeliner is also good, so I want to try it haha ​​Olive Young is a drug store I go to very often, but it's YouTube I didn't know you were doing it ㅠㅡㅠ As soon as I saw it, I immediately subscribed~ I'll support you!
My eyes are prone to eye liner, so even though it has not been long since I drew eyeliner, I was always upset and annoyed. Thank you for the useful video that is perfect for you
I also knew that Clio would be number one!!! I'm also using Clio as a pencil. Haha I'm using a brush pen for Merge, but I've heard a lot of good things about the pencil type and Lily by Red, but I want to try it.
Clio is so good that it doesn't smudge!!!! I'm already exhausted, so I bought two yesterday!!! I used to only use the brush pan liner, but I really like the Clio pencil liner because it doesn’t smudge and I use it to fill the mucous membranes!!
The Clio Pencil eyeliner is very famous, but because it is made of a pencil, it draws well and is thin, so there is less chance of failure!!!!
And it's good that it doesn't erase well.
wow thanks for the good info
I like to draw with a pen eyeliner underneath, but my friends say it's cheap and good!! I'm using the brush pen eyeliner for a while, but I like it. My hand fan is blah blah⫬ㅋ I sympathize with you. The rest is really thin oh,,
I'm going to go get eyeliner after Chuseok right now ㅠㅠ️️ I was taking a photo shoot in Dadam week, but when I tried to put on a light makeup, I saw that there was no Ara TTTT So I'm going to go buy it right away.
The real Clio waterproof pencil liner is so good that I want to recommend it to everyone who uses it ㅜㅜ It makes me tremble a little ️ Once I draw it, it never smudges and it doesn't feel oily!!! I was recommended by a friend last year, so I always use Clio's ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Everyone, go to Clio...Please...plz
No one in my family wears makeup these days, but I'm particularly interested in makeup these days.
Wow, did you dig into my heart ... I was looking for a power proof pencil, and it's really, really, really ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ Clio was also trying to live, so it's nice to have the top....I don't really like Ara because I'm pairless, but the real pencil Ara is a gift from God .. ...and a real dappak
I often watch Olive Young Channel because of gift concerns, but only Sammy's video... Am I looking for it ^^;;
As a gift for my friends and dongsaengs, I always gave them a lip!
Be happy with 6 daughters~ Kazua~
I usually don't draw eyeliner well because I have a lot of oil in my eyes, so I don't know what to buy, so I don't have eyeliner, but I heard what you said about Psy Concert in today's video and wanted to buy it,,,,, ,,,,,, nothing else, I went to a psy concert, but it didn't spread,,,,,,,? OMG,,,,,,,, thank you for the good information,,,
My eyes are unmatched and I have a lot of eyebrows, so eyeliner is important, but if my eyes are oily or not, they smear well ㅠㅠ When I test it on my hands it is fine, but when I put it on only my eyes, it smears ㅠㅠ I'll trust you this time and buy the merge!!
*I hope there will be a shading episode next time!!
Whoa, all Alain is awesome, I've never used a pencil before.
I've always only bought liquid brush pens, but it's really great ㅠㅠ I can't even throw away the liquid I have and I hope I win it ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Thank you so much for all the great tips Yongryong ㅠㅠ
Again, it's been awhile since I've shopped for Olive Young, but I can already hear the sound of my wallet being opened.. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha) But the guides for All-Right were amazing, so I want to try the products for 2nd and 3rd again.. Thank you so much for the always good information ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
The All Alain Guide is really the best ㅠㅠ I have a lot of oil on my eyes, so my eyeliner erased really well, so I couldn't even draw it because I was selling it. I always looked at All Young and bought something, but I couldn't buy it. I can't give up makeup.
I was looking for a non-smudged eyeliner
It is Olive Young who did not disappoint as expected♡
I just ran out of eyeliner and was going to buy it haha ​​I have to buy it from the top 3!
I didn't have enough money, so I drew eyeliner with eyebrow or eyeshadow for almost half a year, but I want to draw eyeliner with eyeliner this time. I don't know what good eyeliner is, so I've been thinking about it every day and couldn't even buy it. It looks good so I want to have it.
After all, it's a famous item, so I've also used the 1st Weekly one ^^* with the rest
How about Lily by Red~ I'm curious ♡
The first time I used eyeliner was because it was such a powerful product...I really only wore dark eyeliner for a year, but Olive Young is reliable, so I'm going to try again this time. I didn't dare to try it easily, so I procrastinated and procrastinated every day, but I believe in Olive Young and have used it every time, so I guess I'll try again... I think the thin core is also really good....if it doesn't break!
What is it ㅠㅜㅠ I knew it as soon as I saw it!!! Of course, Lily by Red is telling my friends that I like this TTㅠ It’s natural and the tail correction is slightly missing, just one correction is perfect!! Merge! Merge is good, but despite living in the Seoul area, she visited several Olive Young, but she couldn't see Mudge. ...
That's why I always buy online. I can't always find a merged one!! Please fix the problem, Clio!! That Cheongdam-dong teacher Ham Kyung-sik praised it, so it doesn't smudge and lasts great. Clio is especially famous for brows.
I'm a student now and I only get 10,000 won a month for pocket money, so I can't use good cosmetics, but all my friends wear makeup so they use cheap ones. This great opportunity has come and I want to participate. I really hope that I win.
Maybe my eyes are weird(?) I'm one of those people who have a lot of blurring... I'll have to try it again with this All-Young product I was introduced to, I'm looking forward to it~~
It's an item I always have in my friends' pouches, but it's really thin...!! I used to only use the clio to meet, but I'm going to change it to a merge at this opportunity..!
Also Clio!!
No one can follow!!
Wow, look at the timing, my original eyeliner didn't fit ㅠㅠ I was looking for another product ㅠㅠ
Clio really doesn't smear well. It's thicker than Kate I bought in the past. I bought the merge, but it was more smudged than Clio, so I gave it to someone else.
I really need to buy an eyeliner, it's great
Originally, I wore Clio's, but I think it'll be good with a small, slim fit!! Let's participate in the event when you need eyeliner/ Even if you don't win, you are willing to save your money and buy it.
Count the event date and spend every day
After seeing this video, I bought a Clio and used it, it's great
I broke up with my boyfriend and cried for over 2 hours.
not smearing at all
It's on an all-young sale this time, and if you buy it while it's on sale, the Clio will also be 6600 won.....!!! Lil Barre, Merge, and Clio are all so famous... I'm going to have to buy this while repurchasing the Clio.
I saw it here and bought it with confidence, but it spreads terribly. It is thin, so it cuts easily, and it dries even with the lid closed.
When I use the pencil liner, I always look like a panda over the twin couple line, so I switched to a brush pen~~~ I enjoyed the reviews ^^
Please do the brush pen liner too!!
I really like all Clio’s cosmetics ㅠㅠ I only use Clio’s foundation, eyeliner, and shadows ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Clio is the best
Clio!!!
Clio eyeliner is the best
 I've had luck outside, but I'm afraid it'll be ugly
I went to the bathroom with my face covered, but nothing smudged.
I'm a beginner in middle school makeup, so what kind of product does not smudge well and has strong durability?,, ㅠㅠ
Clio I'm going to go dark brown, try drawing a smudging effect like Sammy~
I need to go to Alb Young, but Korna is blocking it ㅠㅠ
Ha ha.. I spent more than 300,000 won during this all-young sale, but I can hear the wallet opening again... Isn't Olive Young's sales power too good..?? Clio is very famous for its cushions, so I used only cushions, but I didn't know if the eyeliner would be good too!! The all-alin guide for eyeliner nomads is really ️ I go to Olive Young to buy the recommended all-alin guide ㅠㅠ God Live Young Love View
pencil pencil !!
It was difficult to write with a brush pen!!
I change it with a pencil shhhhh!!
I didn't have any real money... I couldn't even buy it during the fall sale.
What do you use to erase things that are not easily erased?
Clio doesn't really smudge at all, but it's so thin that it broke right away.
Eyebrow TOP3 please
Huh, I thought I'd used them all, but I've only used 3rd place. I need to repent!!
I am a person who absolutely needs to fill in the mucous membranes, but if I use a pencil eyeliner on the mucous membranes, it spreads easily, so I was worried. It spreads well, but I think I can find the eyeliner of my life with this eyeliner recommendation!! And I think the best tip is to apply a soft pencil eyeliner underneath with an eyeliner brush!! If you apply a shadow on the under triangle zone, it is easily erased, but if you fill the triangle zone with a pretty and natural brown pencil eyeliner, it will last longer and look innocent!! I think this video is full of great items and tips.
Participate~♡
Lily by Red doesn't really get rid of it... Even with cleansing, it doesn't come off well...
It's really strange.
And the Lilybyred brush pen splits and spreads well.
Hoheung Old Youngs~~ Next time, please do a blush too. I've used the pencil Ara Lil Bare before, but I bought a thin one, I bought a thick one.
Clio-chan
like ️
Everyone, really, use Merge eyeliner...!!!
My eyes tend to be oily, so I was a nomadic eyeliner...! Lily by Red Clio I've used all of the ones out there once, but it all smeared in my eyes.
So, student YouTubers used a lot of merge eyeliner, so I bought it with tears in my eyes.
It is now my must-have item.
Everyone, be sure to use the Clio Pencil, use it twice, no, use it for a lifetime. Since I am a Taekwondo demonstration team, I exercise every day and it does not smudge even once.
I often go to Olive Young after watching All Young’s recommended videos, but middle school students don’t say hello or anything like that..?
parents before
When I went with you, he greeted me well, but he only said that to my peers... It doesn't matter whether he did it or not, but I felt a little disappointed with Olyoung.
I bought all three
In the afternoon, smears under her eyes ㅜㅜ
For those with oily skin, I recommend pen liner and liquid~
What is it, why is there no charge ㅠㅠ I use pencil Ara, thank you for the good information
Lilva Merge Clio The people who have been smeared are APIugs Same price, much better quality ㅇㅇ
How about a brush pen?
My eyes were smeared with oil because I had a lot of oil.
If you don't know Clio, you're a spy.. I believe you too..
Clio draws well, but it bleeds.... I use it twice and never use it.
Subscription complete
The Lily Bye I wrote before is smearing... ㅜㅜ
It said it wouldn't spread soon, but it's spreading terribly ㅠㅠ
I like my dog
I'm going tomorrow..
Clio and Lilybyred are so small that they don't go back after a week or so.
I went all-young yesterday and I'd like to buy that..
I've used Clio, but it smeared so well... I bought it once and haven't used it.
I don't like Ara, but I have to prepare it from now on~
Why does my Clio also spread.. ㅠㅠ
It spreads...
=========End of Crawling===========
The real Olive Young always makes me feel good when I go into the store, whether I buy it or not, because of the many kinds and variety of products.
I don't know why the All Young channel was created just now.
Really these days, I can't visit in person because of Corona. Even when I was able to go, I asked for recommendations because the part-timers were too busy.
You can know the best selling products by category at Olive Young, and at the same time, even the reviews from the staff.. You can buy it with confidence ︎ As a color lover, the Clio Palette comes in a variety of formulations, so it looks useful and I like it ㅠ-ㅜ
Crazy Olive Young introduces products directly, so please post more useful information in the future!!!! I'm watching the video very well
I like the #1 color palette the most.
In All Young, only honey items are collected, so I like them all ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I have to praise the person who made Olive Young really ️
I really like this kind of content ,,,All the staff are so fun hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I've seen it too!
I didn't know if there were such good new products in Olive Young. I want to go to Olive Young and sweep it all away. I'm more curious because these products are recommended by the long-time staff members.. Thank you so much for holding such great events every time.
I am using the rom & juicy lasting tint that I received last time as a winner! It's also good to put it on dry lips as a finishing touch haha ​​I felt that I had a really deep relationship with Olive Young. I was a part-time student + Experienced various products as a top reviewer of All Young + Lara Styler in progress + I have won a lot of events and actually buy a lot. I'm a person! To be honest, I don't think I've ever been disappointed with a product that has been in the store for several years. I will! I always enjoy watching Olive Young's videos. The store manager and captains come out, so I feel a sense of intimacy. Please upload more interesting videos in the future.
When I go to Olive Young, the products that are always the best do not disappoint. When I go to buy the tint I really want to buy, I am completely missing out on the real stock talk. please upload!!
Olive Young is holding an event like this ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm just really grateful TTㅠ I really wanted Clio shadow and perfume, but I'm so grateful that you opened it up right away ㅠㅠ I know a lot of good things about other products too ㅎ Even if you don't win, you must go and buy it So much TTTT It looks good Olive Young is the best ️️
Dermatori pad, which is number one in the basics, is so good because it is an essence book! You can use the remaining essence like a mist, so I've tried the best oral oral product in usability, but I want to try it!!
I am enjoying watching Olive Young's product introduction in a fun way without being boring..
I like Olive Young for giving good information and good tips ~ There are too many products I haven't tried;
Clio's palette is really great, the shape of the shadow is so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I've seen Thera Breath is really good, but now it's so good that I don't have to buy it directly ㅠㅠ
I thought something obvious, something I already knew, but it was my first time seeing anything other than Dermatory, so it was good because it was fresh ️ Sori-nim is a perfect quote maker Talking about bad breath during TheraBreath, he said that this is coming out of here, and he said that this is Dermatory Pad Essence Yang Hyeja. There is only radish, but he also has broth👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
I went to see the perfume after watching the webd, but you did a really good job of expressing the scent hahahaha I think the Clio Shadow Palette looks really good, so I'm thinking of getting one when I go to Olive Young on the wall ㅠㅠ
A real Clio is a Clio
The brush quality and shadow colors seem to be the masters of color.
The sweet melancholy price is really reasonable.
Isn't it a complete benediction to be big and cheap?
I really love and love() and always use the products from Olive Young and here, all of the products I was looking for and the products I wanted so much came out so quickly. It's a combination!! With these products, I dare not decide which one is better and these are so sweet!! I really do not write comments at all and I am a person who always silently supports me as a customer as a subscriber, but Olyoung is helping me overcome that today..!! All of the All Young employees in this video seem to be so fresh and lively (only a princess and a prince can work) They always give me strength with lively videos, even when I go shopping at Olive Young. Olive young gives vitality and vitality! (Wow~~ You turned the stage upside down in my heart
It was the first time I knew that Olive Young was holding an event like this,,! After watching this video, there are such things. I think I was able to find out a lot of things that people like! It's very interesting and I'll be seeing it often in the future, so I'm going to use something good too!
I'm a fan of Clio, but seeing the Clio palette really makes me want to use it ㅠㅠ The colors are really diverse and pretty, but it's a must-have product for me.. It's so pretty. It's just
First of all, it is an Olive Young product that I trust and use, but there are new products coming out hahaha ^^
I'm very much looking forward to it, so good luck to win ^^
wish
All of the products in Olive Young are great!! It seems like I always live only in All Young! We do a lot of events and, above all, I love that you can buy really good products at a low price when they are on sale.
They are all so pretty ..️
I will be really happy if I really win anything or anything. I really love you for hosting an event like this. Happy 2020
Oh .. Olive Young and I are inseparable beings ..... ️ Just love
Thank you for hosting this event!!
I usually use gargle all the time, but since Thera Breath is famous, I definitely want to try it!! Stores near my house are all sold out. The store managers and staff recommend this product, so I want to try all the others!
Olive Young seems to be a place where you can go in and have fun looking around even if you don't have any products to buy, then buy something and come out.
thanks for the good event
When I was working part-time, it was the first time I entered the warehouse for the new Clio Prism Palette, and I remember how pretty all the staff went hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Halutin.. Is it true that Terra Brass finally entered the store? ㅠㅠ I only bought direct every time.
I'll have to run to Olive Young today to buy it ㅋㅋ This new shadow palette is too bright-)
What's New in Spring
I'm going to pay 100,000 won for Olive Young...
Wow Olive Young This new product is crazy. It's crazy.... Among them, the Clio palette that attracts the most attention, come into my pouch right now...!!
As expected, Olive Young...♡ New products are great, especially Clio products are so pretty. I have to go shopping tomorrow at Olive Young. Thank you for always working hard!!!
The real Clio seems to have been made by all the color craftsmen.
The brush is also great. A friend's everyday, I used it only for testing ㅠㅠ I want to try it ㅠㅠ
If you wake up in the morning and put on a mask, it's an all-time high level hwasaengbang, but if you use TheraBreath, it'll be worth living Aeyoung!
The near list perfume is so cute, it would be nice to have one at a time!!
Wow Olive Young I love you so much... I've always been completely obsessed with it ㅠㅠ Personally, I like the quality of the Clio brand so much that I look at it every time a new product comes out. That Prism Air eye palette... As soon as I saw it, it grabbed my heart. Heuk Heuk also didn't disappoint Clio's expectations... And that Terra Breath!!!! I've heard a lot of good reviews about it, but can you buy it at Olive Young?!? I think it went well for the video!!! Originally, I wanted these two, but the All Young employees were so good at introducing them... All of the products were sold... Hehe I think I can use whatever product comes in. If I really win, go to the Olive Young store. I will upload me to . I really like this event ㅠㅠ Thank you for hosting the event.

olive young
Olive young is famous, but there is a reason it is famous.
I'll have to go to Olive Young once.
There are so many things I want to buy and the number of products I want to try keeps increasing.
There are so many good products.
Wow, I think you're really good at explaining.. I think I'm going to be sold out TTㅠ And why is Clio like this ㅠㅜ You tell us about the number one product in each field? I want to be ㅜㅜ I love you Olive Young
Olive young The price is really good and the products are all very good ㅠㅠ Thank you for hosting the event♡
The Clio Palette is a product that I used to be proud of. The Terra Breath is very spicy when I gargle, and it doesn’t last long, so it made me want to wear it right away. The Dermatory Cica Gauze Pad is my favorite product. I think you are using it yourself. The price of perfume is reasonable, so you can easily access it, so I'll have to find a store that has a store and test it out and pick up a scent I like.
There are so many types of hand sanitizers that I was struggling to decide which one to buy, but I liked this product because it has a large capacity and, most importantly, it doesn't smell like alcohol! The Olive Young YouTube channel was created, and part-timers and store managers came out to introduce what products were steamed and also introduced the favorite items of consumers who use them. I feel like I'm going to become a slave to Olive Young. Take my money,,,
Products that I have seen all of.. I am only now aware of these helpful items ㅠㅠ I want to try them one by one!!
really hot! I thought I was getting burns!! Are you excited about the enthusiasm of the staff? Wow really, these days, because of Corona, I can't even go to olive oil and I can't go out, so I was depressed. Thera Breath Dermatory Pad Near List Perfume Clio Hand Sanitizer looks great!! Why are you stimulating my purchase desire by choosing so sensibly?! If Corona gets better, it's real~ I'm going to run out~ Of course, it would be better if I won the event before that.>< The YouTube algorithm is very special!! I didn't even know there was a channel called Olive Young ㅠㅠ I'll watch it often from now on!! All the staff and people involved, be careful of corona and have a happy day~!!♡ I love you♡
Wow, isn't it so pretty.. Cosmetics are Olive Young that I believe in and look at. I really want an eye palette. I love you ️️
I didn't know about the products in Olive Young other than the color items, but there were a lot of other honey items.
I am getting good information
Smart people.. Anyway, I was going to go and rob it tomorrow after a long time.
Like this again.. I will definitely buy Thera Breath and the pad.
Olive Young Product Ranking It's comfortable to film this video, but the palette is really pretty ㅠㅠ I like perfume so I went to Olive Young and smelled it myself, right? Gentle hug scent but it's crazy I really like it
But Clio deserves to be number 1 in color tone..
I haven't used it yet, but it's really pretty ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Seeing it here makes me want to buy more.
Olive Young TTㅠ The staff informed me directly, so I believe more and get good things!!
Thank you for supporting me like this.
Sarah Mayo Olive Young..
Since it's Olive Young, I'm sure I'll be able to squeeze out any product.
The staff personally review it, so it looks even better!!
Jicha is so pretty..
All products are number one!! I want to buy all the products, but the fact that they are empty.. I saw the Clio shadow palette at Olive Young and it was really pretty.
I really recommend Dermatory products. When my skin turned upside down, I used that to calm it down every day ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like it.
Really almost every day?? I can hear Olive Young.. It's right in front of the academy.. I always buy something and come out ㅋㅋ I love going every day ㅠㅠ There are a lot of new products this time, and I feel so good!!
I tested the Clio Prism Air and it was so good!! Olive Young is doing a really good job ㅠㅠ And thank you so much for the event ️️
In this episode, it seems that only products that really know why they are tops have come out! I go to Terra Brass Olive Young more than 4 times a week ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It's not there every time I go. And what do you say? Even if it’s a color system top, Lee Sang-moo, Clio! From the color tone to especially the eyebrows, there are a lot of products that I can understand why the price is really, really, really, really, say more. I think the managers who come out even though they are wondering what will come up have a good sense hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
The Clio palette is amazing..There is no way to throw it away. I am a warm-toned to the bone, so I will participate carefully..Hehe I always support Olive Young, who always seems to love consumers!
Why are you opening so many Ebeng these daysㅇ Oh yeah, I think All Young smells really good!!
When that time comes, I go all-young haha ​​To see top products on All-Young even on YouTube like this, Omo-omo Clio Shadow is really a product that an application like me should definitely buy... Pretty colors are all right... All-Young employees Everyone is so kind and talking to each other is so much fun hehe I'm going to go buy this after referring to this video
I can't go to Olive Young these days because of Corona, but it's nice to hear about Olive Young on YouTube~~ And even events ㅠㅠ I love Olive Young ️
It's surprising that the TOP 5 of 2020 Olive Young's new product rankings are already out.
Haven't tried it yet, but I'm tempted to buy it.
Looking at myself, I think I'm doing too much
Wow ️ I'm getting a lot of good tips after seeing this ㅠㅠ I'm going to buy hand sanitizer right now Olive Young Chego
Wow Thera Breath was exactly what I needed haha ​​I'm going to go buy it right now
Even if I fill it up, it goes out and when I fill it up, it goes out.. Even if I try to buy it, I can’t buy it TTTT It’s really popular!! I want to buy it and try it!!
Thera Breath hit case... Can I stop buying it with direct purchase ㅠㅠ Etude also joined Olive Young, but it's crazy...
I think this is a product that I really need.
Thank you for letting me know about a good product that I didn't know about.
Dermatory Hypoallergenic Cica Rescue Gauze Pad

This product with a long name is a really good item!

There are a lot of blog reviews, too, but I stick to my cheeks before makeup.

If you put on makeup after a few minutes, your makeup will go well too!
I go to Olive Young very often.. Strangely, it's a product I've never used before ㅠㅠ I really want to try it!!
Really ㅠㅠ Should I order the Clio palette online or offline, but I was worried because I didn’t know where to buy it offline, but I’m really young at Olive Young and explain it so well ️️
This part of the Clio palette is very coveted.. ㅠㅠ All the colors are tearful glare..!! I really like the Dermatory gauze pad! I'm going to Olive Young tomorrow hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Wow, there are a lot of good rumors about Thera Breath, so I thought I'd buy it directly, but it's in Olive Young!! i love you
️ Thank you for the event ️
I always trust and use Olive Young products, but a new product is here!! That's cool. But it's true that you even open events... It's Olive Young who believes in you. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I had really bad acne, but after receiving a recommended item from Olive Young and using it for about 2 months, my skin became smooth and honey! So I went around praising and advertising Olive Young and its products. Hehe I also use Peripera, 3ce, sold by Olive Young for tint and lipstick. I love Olive Young like this I don't do it and watch it till the end haha ​​I also bought some of the products you recommended and am using them!! Thank you so much for the event :) I don't know if it will work or not, but if it does, I'll be very grateful and will use it well.
It's the first time I've heard of Terra Breath, but looking at the comments, there are a lot of good comments ?! I'll have to try it once hehe I think it's better because there are so many amazing products I've never seen before!
I should have bought a palette, but it was really helpful. The design is pretty and there's a reason why it's number one!! I'm going to look for it right now.
On the channel I met for the first time today
You are getting such good information :)
I believe in Olive Young,
Olive young to the National Assembly,
Clio really picked it up well this season..ㄹㅇLu..and since the gargle is so good, I want to try it, but the price is too high ㅠㅠ I'll have to aim for a discount time,, ㅠ
Take a picture of the all-alin guide every day... it's so much fun
The cosmetics I used often came out too, so I got excited watching the video hehe Olive Young is the best!
I really love you Olive Young
I feel like I want to wipe everything out there...
Thank you for letting us know about great products
I bought gargles and hand sanitizer.
I have a sense of pride that I bought all the hot stuff hehe I love the hot new recommendation hehehehe
Wow, I didn't have the will to buy them, but after watching the video, I was persuaded and my wallet is going to be stolen.
Oh they all look good ㅠㅠㅠㅠ It’s good because there are so many honey items.
The Clio Prism Air eye palette is literally so bright,, ️ It's full of pretty colors ㅠㅠ
Hey, thank you for such a great event and I always support you ㅠㅠ
Happy Olive Young!!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, a part-timer coming in tomorrow, it looks empty right away... well, when you go into olive young, you buy something one by one... first you have to buy oral products unconditionally...
All Clio products have great durability ㅠㅠ A friend said that the Clio palette is a life item, so I tested it.....
I love Olive Young, I've never won, but I've tried once!
Hahaha the staff came out and explained it to me, so it's more interesting. Hehe explained the perfume in detail, so I'll have to try it sometime later when I go to All Young.
Huh, what can I say? I am a person who attends Olive Young quite often from the 4th grade of elementary school until now as an adult. There are many events, so the best part is for a reason

there is!! What's the big deal ㅠㅠ Tushi-pache events, discounts, and jackpots The really strange thing is, what's the reason for a storm sale only during high school exams?
thank you so much for the event
Ah……Myrstein ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Clio’s dog pom-poop come here ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
If it adheres to the crazy color combination and the soft texture, it adheres! If it's colored, it's colored! Really No. 1 Coral color combination I didn't like it, I didn't yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooed about was was be a warm tone heart. Well, if that's the case, Clio is a Clio. Really Clio, you're already 'Lee' on the verge of going over 'do' and 'missing'... ....... No, I'm already crazy hahaha
I really love you for making the sale so tight these days, thank you for always being kind to All Young Pam and recommending good products!!
Ahhh I really love Clio, the color master, Clio always has a sense of urgency.
The hand sanitizer that I just picked without thinking was number one hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha well
That shadow palette was really praised by YouTubers, so I'm really curious about how it goes.. It's a pity that I couldn't sweep it out at this all-new sale ㅠㅠ I'm satisfied with my eyes like this.
No ㅠㅠ Olivier Young This event is so great ㅠㅠ I hope I win it ㅠㅠ It's the new semester, and I'm so empty, I'm wearing makeup with strange cosmetics I bought at the time I didn't know the tone of the store. I'm going to work hard to take care of my skin with this and I'm going to make flies slippery ㅠㅠ Anyway, I'm going to wipe it all away soon ㅠㅠ It's true that everything can be solved just by going all year without paying shipping cost?? No, I struggled every day because of the shipping cost, so I bought it more expensively ㅠㅠ I can't really pick up ten of them and stock them up, but I'm going to buy them periodically. Especially, the shadows are really bright, the design is pretty, and the colors are great. This is going ㅠㅠ I have to give up keeping my bankbook ㅠㅠ
Why is that palette so pretty .. You fell in love at first sight ... I'm going to participate in the event!!
The color tone... it's the best really ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
The competition is so fierce, I think it's because all the products are essential to life.
I'm going to watch the review video..
Wow, an event like this at Olive Young...hehe My skin is turned upside down a lot and I really want to get Dermatory products ㅠㅠ Even if I don't win the event, I have to go and buy it ㅠㅠ
Terra Breath is great ㅜㅜㅜㅜ I always bought it through direct purchase, but it's coming to All Young like this ㅜㅜㅜㅜ Thank you so much
Olive Young is truly with us for the rest of our lives... At some point, Olive Young has become an indispensable and indispensable existence for many people including myself... ....I'm still a student, so even though I don't have a lot of money, I'm happy whenever I go there, and my wallet is shaking just by shopping for kids... I really like Olive Young's own brands... Working hard... ㅠㅠ I'm really, really, really grateful... Especially, the recently launched service called Today Dream is a service that is much faster than general bullet delivery that I want everyone to know, so when something really runs out or you need something urgently Still, there are many products that deal with Olive Young, but there are really only things that you can just find... I love you all the time...
This event is a big hit, I have only the really essential items and I don't have any real money, so I honestly don't feel pressured, but it's an event!! Wow, I don't think the ashes will be pulled out, but I'll put my hopes up and apply.
and near-list perfume ...
I was very curious when it came out on XX.
Wow, that was it... The price was around 30,000 won and 20,000 won.
I think it would be so good ㅠㅠ
Terra Breath,,,, It was very inconvenient to be able to buy only through direct purchase, but to have joined Olive Young ㅠㅠㅠ This is very good news ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm running right away to check out the rest of the new products ️
If it wasn't for Olive Young, my skin would still be full of acne, my hair would still be full of acne, and I wouldn't have been able to use a color tone that matches my skin tone.. If you go to a real cosmetics store, you will definitely love Olive Young. did you!!!
In particular, that Dermatory pad product is really..I am using it for the 3rd time because it has become a staple in my life. I just want to join Olive Young.
Clio palette is awesome ㅠㅠ Thank you for the event
Clio ㅠㅠㅠㅠ The color is really pretty, but the color is also the color, but the case is very pretty ㅠㅠ But because I'm a student, I don't have money.
Seriously... there shouldn't be anyone who hasn't tried Terra Breath...
It is less irritating than other gargles, but the effect is better
If you add Dr.Tungs tongue cleaner to this, the world will be refreshed.
Olive young is really crazy.... Olive Young is always on sale. It was on sale a few days ago, so I bought it every day. Nothing, it’s all good Price, ingredients, nothing to look at, everything is good As I said in the real video, it’s good enough to receive the Nobel Peace Prize No, I’m so excited right now that I can’t express it in words Olive Young
Huh, you must be really crazy ㅠㅠ I love you Olive Young ️ I really like the explosion ㅠ Can I drop the dimples.. Oh, how you are so pretty ㅠㅠ Oh, it’s really fun throughout the video ㅠㅠ And Clio.. Prism Air Ah ㅠ The quality is really crazy right now I'm going to buy it.. I love the gun all-alin guide..
Clio really has a lot of life lip and cushion
Huh, that palette is really pretty. How come there are so many rare colors ,,,, I want to have all the products in the video together,,,? I'm going to be full of shit like this ㅜㅜ hehe
It's nice that you don't have to capture each one and it's all sorted out at the end~! Thank you so much for bringing in Terra Breath. Olive young is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
The Olive Young channel is just starting out ㅠㅠ
I've been waiting ️ It was so nice to be able to see the new items right away without going to the store.
I went to the store and they said they had no stock ㅠ It's really hard to find ㅠ
I definitely want to try it this time. I feel depressed because of Corona. I heal while watching the Olive Young channel and I am satisfied with the reviews.
The event at Olive Young ㅠㅜ I really like it ㅠㅜ Thank you for hosting the event ㅠㅜ I really want to be ㅜㅜ ️
Terra Breath Oralins Mild
I think it's good because it smells like mint.
I'm going to buy it from Olive Young and try it out.
Olive young's basic line and body line
After meeting for the first time in high school, Clio fanatics who buy most of their cosmetics at Clio feel great.
I like Olive Young so much that there are 4 versions of Olive Young products, but the Clio eye palette is so pretty that I want to buy it right away.
I haven't tried it yet, but seeing this makes me want to buy it all..
I bought the Clio Prism Air Palette No. 1, but it was so popular when I bought it that it was out of stock, so I went around 3 Olive Young to get it. But it's worth it, a pretty, pretty case, a high-quality brush, and a colorful pearl party.
Terra Breath. Awesome ㅜㅜ
Etiquette after lunch!!!
You came to Olive Young.
ㅜㅜ I love it
There are so many olive young honey items and they have frequent sales so I love it!! Thanks so much for the good info!
The eye palette is really pretty
I think I know why it's number 1~
Hey, there are many Olive Young products, but thank you for picking up and letting me know about these good products.
Thank you for recommending products that are perfect for me, such as moisturizing products for moisturizing products, lip balms for lip balms, etc.
It is an Olive Young product that I always trust and use. Thank you!
The shadows are really pretty..
Everyone is coming, but the first place in oral and body care seems to be coming more strongly! There were a lot of products I didn't know about, so I'm glad I got to know a good product!!
Everyone speaks so well and it was nice to see this video and learn a lot of new good products than I thought.
Replying to @James_Channel
Uhhhh, I watched this with a dry, stinky mouth in the morning and participated in the event as if I was possessed...! I'll have to go and buy all the Olive Young.
Real Olive Young is one of my favorite road shops on a regular basis. ㅜㅜ When I go out with friends or family, I see Olive Young around, even if there is nothing to buy, I definitely go in and look at the products and when I go out, I buy a lot of Olive Young products in my hand. I went to Lululala's house.. Hahaha Olive young in particular has more sales than other road shops, and above all, the staff are friendly and always smiling, so it's fun and fun to shop. And I also replaced the dirty samples with new ones. When I saw the display of the products, I burst into exclamation inside! TTTT But for some reason, I am so happy that Olive Young, my lifelong lover, is holding an event like this. I am interested in beauty because I am more interested in beauty these days. But if I really do win the event, I will post a full review on my Instagram account, such as Instagram and Facebook!
Before watching the video, I went to Olive Young and smelled the near list perfume... it was so good I can see why it's so popular ㅜㅜ
That's great .... You bring so many good items like this TTTTTTTTTT Thank you so much for a great event!!!! There are some kids who just looked up reviews on the internet and said they thought this would be great...but they couldn't buy it.. TTTT So I'm participating like this! Thanks for the great event!
Clio Prism Air Eye Palette The color is really pretty. There are so many colors I want to have, so I'll leave a comment like this.
I ran to see the title, but it's late.
You are new! Thank you so much for this video
Hey, why are you watching this channel now? Subscribe right away
Oh my god, it's steamed!!!
I've always been watching "The recommended item video recommended by Olive Young Part-timer" on YouTube.
I came in exclaiming in admiration that a video of a recommended item recommended by an Olive Young employee was uploaded from the Olive Young official account.
My dream is for Olyoung to become Korea's Sephora.
All brands, all young, Drew and Drew
Olyoung went with her friend and I got 50,000
It comes out in a hurry... Once I go, I will buy it. Thanks to this honey item information, I can shop more practically. Thank you.
Thanks for the event!!!
You explain very well and I always like Olive Young's items every time I see them~
Make sure you win!! Ha ha ha
TheraBreath Oralins Mild
I bought this this time, and unlike the mouthwashes I've used before, it doesn't have a spicy taste and it doesn't sting, so I love it! It definitely reduces bad breath and has a lot of capacity, so I think I will use it for a few months ~~ hahaha
Of the items you introduced, I will not throw away any, and above all, thank you for showing the [Chin Review] in detail and in detail.
Olive Young had a plan from the start.
In particular, while wearing a mask and fine dust reappearing, I carefully examine and purchase products that touch or wipe the skin.
The store manager of 'Dermatory' gauze pad sori demonstrated it on the skin from the point of view of an omniscient customer and released it to the shopping cart!
What is Thera Breath.... Why is the product I have always wanted in my life here.....? ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I usually have really dry mouth, so spray, tongue cleaner, etc. are essential items, but only smells, but I couldn't get rid of dryness... Isn't it a really great item.... The number one place seems to be different.... ㅠㅠ Thanks to you, I know a good product. I'm going to open my wallet...!!!!!
I love this new information! The staff gave me a review, so I trusted them more than other influencers and immediately subscribed.
Ha huh Clio is really great ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ I really like that Clio, but the event....Huh, I'm in tears 😭😭😭 I love the perfume...I also like that perfume haha ​​I don't know. I'm going to write one comment... ㅠㅠ
I want to buy pretty girls, but I'm still a student, so I don't have the money... TTTT
When I saw the video, I suddenly felt pom-pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo into buying
I will participate in the hit event, I am always cheering for you. Fighting. I will notify you of the thanks of the local room. I will do my best to promote it.
This is Cleo's No. 1 product that I trust and use~~ Awesome It's so many colors that it's easy to put on makeup and the color doesn't smudge and I love it!!!
I'm looking forward to the new Olive Young!!!!
The color of Clio is really bright and long itself,,,,,,,,
I haven't tried any of these products, but I'm running to Olive Young right in front of my house hahahahaha
I really want a Clio.
Last time I went to Olive Young, I fell in love with it because it was so pretty, but I didn't have the money to buy it ㅠ These days, pearl shadows are attracted to me ㅠ So I really want to have it. I want to become a makeup expert ㅠㅠ
Olive Young staff recommend it, so I can buy it with confidence ^^/ Please continue to recommend it in the future
I really wanted to try the product, but I can easily find it at Olive Young ㅠㅠ Thank you for letting me know!!
Olive Young Channel Hung Hae Ra
No... Why did I want to buy all of them and then gave up on them...? After all, this is a video where you can feel that people all have the same eyes. Especially that gargle... A must-have in this era of mask necessity! Seriously, the more they talk, the more I feel like I should have it.
This is the first event you will participate in. It's my first time participating in this event, so I'm very honored ️
I'm a student, so I don't have any money. It's a new school year. I'm so excited for these new things. Thank you for the event.
As a fan of Olive Young and a fan of perfume, I have tried many different perfumes in Olive Young, but the near list perfume from the recently hit web drama XX caught my eye first! I went to the perfume section to try the scent at Olive Young, and the product the person next to me smelled smelled so good, so I waited until he left and saw the name of the product. It came out, and the scent matches the characters' personalities well, so it's a product that anyone can use regardless of age or gender, so it's a very appealing product! It's a perfume I've always wanted to try once if I had the chance, and I'm proud to be occupying the top 1 spot like this. Thank you for always uploading good videos.
Thera Breath is really cool. I bought and used it with my teenage boys.
No, I just thought it was funny hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Terra Breath... This is the first brand I've ever heard of..! But Olive Young's review... It's no joke...?! Then it sounds like I should try using it at Olive Young?? thank you
I really like olive young.. it's one of my favorite road shops.
Our family always uses online Olive Young products.
And when I saw the video, the explanation was very detailed, so my trust in the product that I did not use is high.
I'm going to buy Terra Breath soon. I really like this ranking item introduction video ㅜㅜ
I'm using other pad products, but it's amazing that the Dermatory pad also has soup!! Thank you for introducing a good product and opening an event.
Wow... I've been looking for Thera Breath directly for a while ㅠㅠ It's great ㅠㅠ
Hey, I saw everything in the video at the Olive Young store, but I only bought the Clio palette, don't worry, I'll buy everything in the video ㅜㅜ
I often go to Olive Young, but when I say I buy lipstick, I do a lot of testing and worry about which brand to buy, but the Olive Young employees come out and recommend popular products, so I think it will be a great reference for buying things. please upload
Clio, I'll report you right away.
Registration of residence in my heart..
When I go to Olive Young, there are so many really good items~~~ I want all of them and I want to buy them; I really want to buy the shadows in spring;;
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is so funny hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha edit
I'm looking to buy from All Young, and I'll have to refer to the products in the video too! Especially Terra Breath!! It's something I really want to try, but it seems that it hasn't been released online yet ㅠㅠ It's released quickly, so I want to try it too!
I'm going to have to buy one after seeing these honey items!!
thank you every time
I bought it only through direct purchase from Thera Breath, but it came out at Olive Young.... When I couldn't buy directly, I used Listerine ㅠㅠ I will go to Olive Young and buy it right away. thank you!!
Thera Breath is a must-have item to start a cool morning.... Now you don't have to buy it from iHerb.
Nearest EDT Sweet Melancholy looks so pretty and nice!! I want to smell it
Thera Breath~~ The fact that you do not have to buy it directly is a benefit! But it's sad because it's not at a branch I often go to.. I'm going to buy it online during this sale.. I suddenly feel like I'm at a loss while waiting for delivery.. I forgot about this guy's existence before I saw this video.. Maybe it was because I had a dentiste..
I was going to buy a shadow palette, but I just watched the video! The only color I really like is the one I like ㅜㅜㅜㅜ And that gargle was also famous, but now I don't need to buy it right now.
Terra Breath is great.. I was wondering if I should get it through direct purchase ㅠㅠ Thank you
I'm interested in perfume these days, but I usually like neutral scents hehe The price is good so I think it's better! I'll go to the store to test the scent tomorrow.
Ugh,, Olive Young has such a magic that it can be overlooked, right? Everyone live an olive young life
After seeing this video, I bought it at the Terra Breath offline store and it was really good~~ I have only used it for a day, but after gargling with the other gargles, it felt like something was left in my mouth, but it was neat and nice~~
But is Terra Breath not sold on the online website? I can't find it ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
I really like the pad, I skip the basics before putting on makeup and it's so moist and cool even if I just use that, I like it
What..Yesterday I went to Olive Young and I was collecting money to buy the shadows.. TTTT You are pretty. Clio is the best.. Olive Young is a revolution ㅠㅠ Going to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
At Olive Young, the staff are friendly and there are many sales, so I always buy cosmetics only at Olive Young!! Olive Young also has a YouTube channel ㅠㅠ These are products recommended by Olive Young staff~~ It's so reliable. Why didn't I see this before ㅠㅠ
I really like Olive Young, but I'm a student so I can't spend a lot of money ㅠㅠ I want to become an adult quickly and buy the cosmetics I want to buy! I really want to try the Clio Prism Air eye palette ㅜㅜ I use my sister’s cosmetics secretly every day, and I think it would be great if I win.
Thera Breath is really cool. Shinsegae
Olive young is a good product. There are a lot of products with various ideas, so it is very good for viewing and gifting ~ Please prosper
I am a huge fan of Olive Young. There is a store in front of my house, so I stop by every day. I put it on the whiskey list for this spring. I will go to work as All Young tomorrow too!^^ Please introduce more products^^
Olive Young!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love you so much. Every time there is a sale, my bank account balance is getting smaller and smaller because I buy a lot, but I still like it It seems that Dermatory gauze pads are sold now.
I've heard a lot of good things about the Clio eye palette before, but I'm going to try it this time!!
Olive Young Totally Joy ㅜ Once a day, Olive Young
Hmmm Olive Young is the best. Thank you for the detailed review!!
Thank you so much for the event. I wanted to use that famous product, but I didn't know there would be an event like this.
thank you
I often buy Clio at Olive Young, but I'm planning to buy that shadow too ♡ I've been with Olive Young for more than half of my cosmetic life, so let's be together in the future♡
Clio, I only tested it at Olive Young, but unlike other cheap products, the pearls were completely adhered, and there was no flying.
I really like the last sanitizer I work at a private hospital and I keep it in my pocket and sanitize my hands every now and then. All other staff say they like it.

This product is broken, but the product is smooth and moist even after alcohol volatilization.
I don't know if there is an event at All Young too haha ​​I'll be coming here often ㅠTT It's called Clio Prism Air??? It's something I've been wanting to buy ㅠㅠ My nose is crying ㅜㅜ Thera Breath also has a bad breath.
I can get rid of all the pimples on my forehead.
I live in a real village where there is no Allyoung, but when I buy online, I don't test it every day and I'm thinking about whether or not to buy.
Thera Breath is really great. I can see why it is famous. I am very satisfied with this purchase. The Dermatory Cica gauze pad is also hypoallergenic and the essence is also very good for soothing effect.
Please add it to the ampoule.
Ha, I spent 100,000 won at Olive Young yesterday, so I'll have to go again to buy gargles.
As soon as I heard the description of the gargle, I was bummed
I'm going to get a shotgun
Awesome Olive Young!!!
I was curious because there was a Terra Breath product as a recommended item for Olive Young on the internet, but there was a video of All Alain haha ​​I saw the video and my desire to purchase won the grand prize!!!
Thank you for opening the event. I knew what it was, I was thinking about the product I was supposed to buy, but then I forgot it and remembered it again and regretted it hahaha
These are all things I want to try ㅠㅠ People who introduce God All Young products have great senses ㅋㅋ I have a dry mouth, but I want to try Terra Breath.
Hey Olive Young, this kind of talk other than an advertisement video? Recommendation? Is the video coming out again? ㅠㅠ As a Koduk, I'm so happy... I'm so glad I came to Dermatori this year.. I'll have to stock up on it ㅠㅠㅠㅠ.... I'm interested in those gargles and perfumes I haven't used before!! I'll subscribe and watch the video in the future!! ㅠㅠ
Whoa, who is the 1st place if Clio doesn't really take 1st place? I do it hahaha Clio, besides the eye palette, the cushion is too heavy, and the eyeliner and eyebrow are also Eva.
Clio...As expected, you should buy Clio with confidence.. It's nice to know things that I didn't usually know!!
I always trust the items recommended by Olive Young staff.
I have nothing to criticize haha
Everything is good and pretty
All shopping ends with one olive young! I'm going to go look for shadows and perfumes
As I am also a student, the price is burdensome, so unless I receive sharing like this, it is definitely difficult to use it ㅜㅜ Thank you for hosting a sharing event!
I like Thera Breath the most. It's like a Nobel Peace Prize (?) haha
I need to stop by the No. 1 perfume store soon. I can hear the people who came out.
Wow, seeing this makes me want to buy all of them ㅠㅠ
I was really curious about Terra Breath!!
I must go buy it
I trust Olive Young to buy my birthday gifts and my products. I go often because it is in front of my house as a regular at Olive Young, but I buy a lot of konjac jelly and sanitary napkins from Olive Young.
I wanted to try the gargle, but I couldn't use it because I had to buy it straight away!! I'll go get it right away
What... I'm embarrassed because the things I've been eyeing and what I've been plowing are in the rankings...
It's a moist gargle,,,,,,,,,,, I really want to use it ㅠㅠ
I am a student who has opened her eyes for makeup. I don't know what to use for a good cost-effective shadow palette, but I think it would be good to use Clio products. Female~ 6 o'clock Clio Hwahae cushion 1st place, but in All Young, it occupies the 1st place on the eye palette. Go out and wait for school to start.. (This time, online school started on April 9th..haha) I can't go out because of Corona, but I won't miss out on being pretty.
When it comes to cosmetics, as someone who used to buy at Olive Young, Etude is also coming in these days.
I like the sale a lot too.
And to the event!! Thank you always ^^
I had a lot of fun reading from the review products of Sori Fat, to the products reviewed by Daungi Ahung..
 Everyone has a good chemistry, so I think you can appear on TV Home Shopping.
I want to buy all of them haha
Thera Breath Oralins is my favorite item~ It's so good to see you at Olive Young~
When opening Dermatory for the first time, the entrance is blocked, so be careful when opening it! My index finger was hurt!! It's been working fine since then!!
All of them have great chemistry and it's so much fun! Hahaha
I want to try Nearist EDP Sweet Melancholy
To the extent that people's liking for people increases depending on what kind of scent they smell.
I want to try the No. 1 fragrance product recommended by Olive Young.
I've been using the Dermatory pad consistently, and it's really soft and nice..TT And the Clio palette...it's really pretty.. Clio believes in and trusts in Olive Young!!
I always buy cosmetics at Olive Young.
Olive young fighting!!
If you go out every day when you have an appointment, you can hear it even if you don't have anything to buy, but I only paid attention to the color cosmetics section, so I didn't know there were other honey items like this!!!! ㅠㅠ These days, a lot of YouTubers introduce snacks too, but next time I'll have to get some of these new items and snacks +_+
Olyoung is really Joah ㅠㅜ
I go to Olive Young in front of my real house three or four times a day, so my mom goes there so often that she asks if it's your house... It's essential when it's on sale, and if you need anything, I go and memorize all the items there and even the staff Even people recognize me now.... But that Clio Prism Air eye palette is really, really, really pretty. My favorite color is coral, so I'm really thankful. I am confident that I will wear makeup with this every day and even verify the winner. I hope that Olive Young will shine on me just once. I will continue to visit Olive Young frequently.
I love cosmetics so much that I said I spent half of my pocket money on Olive Young, but Clio is the best..
Thank you for the event
This is such a Hyeja event, of course, Olive Young!!

I've been completely coveting that shadow palette since I've been hearing a lot of good things about it these days! After all, Clio is a color shadow restaurant. The reflected light is shiny, fluffy, moist, and powdery, and if the brush is good, it has all the advantages of a shadow palette.
Hull I wanted to try TheraBreath, but I heard that you joined All Young ㅜㅜㅜㅜ You came in because of TheraBreath, and you are sold by Clio.
I'm really looking forward to the new product. I want to go to Olive Young soon ㅜㅜ
Only certain hot items are gathered.
I'm going to watch a good video
Thera Breath is a product I was wondering if I should buy it directly! I have to run to Ollip Young right now~~~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!
It looked like a TheraBreath advertisement, but I bought it with the guise of being deceived...
I think I go to see it with my own eyes at least once a month. It was nice to be able to easily recognize the products selected by Hwahae and Director Pie by looking at the app. I love Olive Young, which is indispensable in my life.
Whenever I need a change of mood, even if I don’t go out, I’m interested enough to spray perfume. >< I looked at the thumbnail and looked at what was the number one perfume, but I saw that the near-listed brand perfume that I had heard for the first time was number one, so I wanted to try it. It's a musk scent, but you can feel it at the same time!.. I think it's a more reliable review video to see if it's good to try other items once in a while♡♡
There are many useful tips for going to Olive Young often.
Olive Young is an event I usually go to.
I always bought and used the TerraBreath candy, but this is the first time I've ever seen an Ax en-type.
I'm going to buy this at Olive Young instead of buying it directly this time~
I really had no regrets buying Clio palettes, but a new palette is coming out this time ㅠ Isn't it so shiny and pretty ㅠㅠ??? Olive Young has a lot of really good items, so the store masks are empty and they come back. If you want to create a really gorgeous makeup, or if you want to use pretty colors, or if you want to use a shadow palette even with cool tones, I really recommend Clio ㅠㅠ This March, a friend's birthday present. I gave him Clio Shadow Palette + Lipstick (random gift) as a gift through Kakao Talk. My friend had a cool tone, but the products were mostly warm tones, so I think there were some products that didn't suit me. I gave this as a gift because it was recommended to me that it suits me well, but my friend said that it suits him perfectly, he said it was perfect for him, and that he didn't need all the shadows he had before hahahahahahahahaha I was a little worried because some people said it was warm in the reviews, but my friend I really liked it when I tried it myself, so I'm going to gift the Clio shadow palette to me on my birthday.
I wish there were more olive youngs all over the country~”
It's not only in our neighborhood ㅠㅠ It's sad
If possible, I want to win and try oral products.
You have to have healthy teeth to eat delicious food.
Thanks to those who explain, I think I can understand better!!
I also have a clio shh keke I'll come to the All Young channel often ^^ Please give me good content~
Thera Breath seems to be famous... I'm embarrassed to say I didn't know haha
I want to try it too
If you are really hesitant and sold out, it will only be late. It is better to buy it sooner than others.
I like all 5 products.. Among them, I like the oral hygiene fragrance the most.
I really like the comments from Tungi-nim Sori-nim, it suits him well.
I'm applying for the event, the shadow is so pretty
Still, the Olive Young sale is very busy these days, so I bought it yesterday and today ㅜㅜㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ But I saw this... I'll have to go again.
Strangely, Olive Young's presence of Clio in Olive Young is truly a blessing.
I'm so curious about Therabras!
I'm going to go buy Thera Breath!! I was very concerned about bad breath these days.
I really want to get a dermatory pad and try it out...
It's perfect for walnuts too, try it....
I just subscribed
Olive young that picks out only good things
Everything that comes out is a national item
Do you like it?
Selling Terra Breath at Olive Young...!
I was worried about bad breath, so I was looking for a good gargle.
I'll have to go and buy it tomorrow :-)
school
I'm polite, so I'm interested in oral care, but TheraBreath gargle is out of stock right now.
I really wanted to buy it TT And there was also Olive Young's Dream service today, but I think the idea is really good. I always love Olive Young♡ Participate in the event!
subscribed
It's a very rewarding event to be able to collect and use only the first place products ^^
It's all so good, but the fact that Terra Breath has become easier to access. Mask Can I get rid of the sewer smell now...
There are unsatisfied children here at Olive Young near my house!!!! If I win, it's a real joker....!!!!!! I feel like I've learned about product power that I didn't know while watching the video... I'll have to go find this one.
Being number 1 in the mouth is absolutely amazing.
I looked at other comments and saw that there were a lot of articles saying that Terra Breath is a jackpot. I can believe it that much!!
Eh, that Dermatory product has been out for quite some time... Isn't it new...??
Thanks to the direct purchase that I didn't know, I got it right!!!! I wrote it down. Terra Breath
Why is Thera Breath added to the flavor? Still, it's less spicy than the others.. It's too bad..
I definitely want to use the near list EDT sweet melancholy ㅠ
I love the eyeshadow~^^
Let's seduce someone this spring with charming eyes!
The clio palette is so pretty.
Is there anyone other than me who knows now that there are such great products.. ㅠㅠ I feel a bit embarrassed ㅠㅠ I go to Olive Young very often ㅠㅠ I first heard of the number one oral product ㅠㅠ I really like it ㅠㅠ I guess I'll have to go try it again soon.. Basics No. 1 I like the product too, but I'm really looking forward to what kind of product it will show in the future.
Olive young is very young, but perfume..I want it so much Jungdeun..♡
If you go in Olive Young, you will unconditionally buy one... Today, you put on foundation, concealer, and puff... hehe
This time, during the sale, I bought some of the things I usually use, but while I was buying Clio cushion products, I wanted to buy the palette too haha ​​Of course, I couldn't buy it due to financial problems... but I definitely want to try it after winning an event. I brush my teeth 5 times by default, but Terra Brass is famous, so I have heard of it, so I want to try it out to see if my bad breath will go away ㅠㅠ And I have extremely dry skin with sensitive skin. I don't like trouble ㅠ And I'm a N-Student who took it this time and entered college, but I can't live on campus because of Corona, so I'm just at home. When I went to Olive Young, the staff were always friendly and I was able to do a pleasant shopping thank you :)
I've used this perfume once and it's really good.
it's really cool
What is Clio Prism Air? From the case to the color brush ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
 All young is there every time I go, but when it goes on sale, I buy it again and again.
If it doesn't exist, search for it and buy it if it's famous (shhhh)
When you are really empty, you have to wipe your tears and put your lips on before coming out.
I was worried if I drank the Terra Breath and didn't brush my teeth, but I think it will be a staple in my life.
I recently got a discount of over 100,000 won from Olive Young and bought it at around 50,000 won. Olive Young is really the best ㅠㅠ There's a reason why it's called the number one drug store! I really want both Thera Breath and the Clio palette.

sophielove5818@gmail.com
Terra Breath ... Anji for about 5 years ... A doctor made it for her daughter who suffers from bad breath hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha;
She's a student, so I couldn't buy it even if I was curious.
I really want to be selected!!!!
I want the Clio palette...I want the Terra Breath family...I just want the whole Olive Young..Olive Young = My dog ​​will be the main cause of my tantrums Please work harder
Whatever I buy, I'll shop at Olive Young.
Thanks for the good information ~ ^^
I think the color deserves to be number one ㅜㅜㅜㅜ It's great!! And the fragrance looks really good too..! I'll have to go to Olive Young and do some shopping soon too. Thank you for the event and thank you for the review. It was very helpful!
I've only been at home lately, but I went to All Young for a while because I wanted to buy a lot of rom & glasting water tint. I fell in love with the Clio Prism Air Palette... But I didn't have much money, so I only bought tint with tears in my eyes. It caught my eye ㅜㅜ But thank you so much for hosting an event like this. I definitely want to get that palette after winning.
All-Young is a great feast
Absolutely buy Terra Breath!!! She had a hard time saying she was a jerk in iHerb ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
The Clio Shadow Palette Brush is the only one that clumps up a bit and spreads out thickly...
I want to go buy the perfume and the gauze pad.. The two I want so much..
When I woke up, I was really worried about whether or not to buy Thera Breath due to the smell coming from inside, but I put up with it for financial reasons. It's a coincidence how YouTube knew and recommended it, but it's not a coincidence. I want to feel the freshness in my mouth when I wake up~~~
I'm going to go buy something I haven't tried.
There is a reason why the top5 is the top5.
Even in this time of year, Olive Young can go safely
When you enter the store, they greet you and give you hand sanitizer...
People who are not wearing masks are asked to come in after wearing them and leave!
Is there any chance to taste the new world of gargle?
These days, cleanliness is more important than anything else.
If you use the mask every day, it smells a lot and you can't brush your teeth often in the middle.
Wouldn't the gargle be the best in this case haha ​​I think you can trust the gargle recommended by Olive Young ^^
Among the new OMG items, there is nothing you don't need these days. Well?
Hand sanitizer is essential these days, the skin turns slightly with a mask, but for the same reason, I am concerned about bad breath, but for the same reason, I am concerned about bad breath, in oral linen, in a perfume that is good to spray in the spring, and in other places it is useless because it is covered with a mask even if I put makeup on, so pay attention to eye makeup But even the eye palette !! How useful is it???️
Now go directly to Olive Young without buying a direct purchase.
All Terra Breath is out of stock ㅠㅠ Please restock it.
Yogo is sure to win!
After using TheraBreath, I couldn't use other gargles.. The taste is the taste of water mixed with other gargles, so it's much less irritating. It has a slight mint taste only in the throat, so even people who do not like mint can use it without any hesitation, but the effect is really good hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Personally, the capacity of that cap is too big, so I think my mouth will burst, so about a third is appropriate ㅇㅇ...It is a bit expensive compared to other gargles, but I am willing to repurchase it even if it is more expensive.
I'm going to buy the number one oral cavity right away.
0:57 Are you hiding it for focus? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Clio Shadow is great... I want to try Oraline Smile Mint 5 👌👌
Do not spray and rub the perfume. If you rub it, the fragrance molecules may be broken by minute heat and friction, and other fragrances may appear. The ideal way is to spray and leave it alone.
I don’t know much about mouthwash, but I only use Gagreen I know the name of every day, but Thera Breath is good enough to bring straight to the market.. I love it (Jureuk)
Clio is so bright ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Terra Breath!!!!! I am so very curious!!!
It is fun and very funny to drip while explaining the product.
I hope to do this more often in the future
It's interesting haha ​​But these days, I'm wearing a mask, so my breath smells worse. I'll just have to buy some gargles.
I don't go in to buy Olive Young, but when it comes out, I buy a lot of stuff haha.
I am torn between the Clio Coral Palette and the Espoir Peach Palette.
Olive Young is right in front of me, but every time I went there were so many different kinds, so I did a lot of eye shopping. I didn't know which items I could use usefully, but the staff recommended them directly, so I think I found some good items! Just until March 31st today, Olive Young is the big day of the March Spring Sale. I will stop by Olive Young today and look at the products you recommended!!! Of course, if there is stock.. Wearing a mask regularly, washing hands frequently, social distancing, everyone is practicing for a safe society, I hope the corona will calm down as soon as possible. Fighting until the day you wish for. Fighting Olive Young ️
I thought the green Terra Breath was very sweet...
I should use blue
There are all the products I can't buy because of the low cost... So I'm going to apply for an event...
Where can I see the event announcement?
When I go to Olive Young’s online mall, I always look for new and best products, but when I look at it, even if I don’t need the product, there are a lot of sales going on so I buy it myself ^^ I enjoyed the video~
I'm going to buy the Clio tomorrow...
Is it impossible to purchase Terra Breath in the Olive Young app? I can't find it no matter how much I search.
Olive Young doesn't have anything to buy, but if you pass by and come by, you'll buy something and come out lol But these people aren't kidding about their jokes.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Awesome, really, really cool, I'm always cheering for you, fighting Olive Young
The staff members who appear in All Alain are so cute and fun. Today, I blow away the stress at the All Young Mill♡
Wow Terra Breath!!!
My bad breath, which I found out about the mask these days... I want to get rid of it with gargles...
No, the Olive Young YouTube channel is great because I saw a video of the dental care video before and after seeing the video I was horribly rejected from the event. I robbed all the rankings and wasted my pocket money, but 1st place is really good.
I understand why, so I write it myself and recommend it to my mom and dad, and to everyone around me, and to the kids on their birthdays, just fill them up and take care of them.
Oh my gosh, I'm so short right now ㅠㅠ I'm full
Wow... I want to have it haha
Clio Shadow Mittenda Bling Bling Twinkle Twinkle 5G is 90000 diameter angle indie
Someone please buy my director to get rid of that bad breath.......
Hehe I'm going to take a good look!
I have to give my boyfriend a gift from Terra Breath!!!^^
I want to get rid of bad breath! Moisturize my mouth too!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hahaha no, that cp is the celebrity broadcaster that Kim Tae-jin announcer hahaha he resembles him a little bit hahahahaha something funny
When will Terra Breath come out online???
There are some of my friends who don't like Olive Young, should I really play half-killed (by the way, I was patient)
The first place is the Clio Prism Air Eye Palette, so I have a low credibility... I heard reviews saying that it wasn't good... The color development was weak and the shimmer was severe...
olive young
1:43 I'm going to go buy it
No, you look like a show host!!
Hey Terra Breath!!!!!!!
The ingredients are rotten, why did you do that?
Wow
=========End of Crawling===========
Hahaha The parody was really good 👍👍

How many dramas and movies are there in one advertisement?

But the trap is that they all fit together haha
I'm really going crazy hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.. It's getting bigger and bigger as an advertisement hahaha I'm going to space
I knew it was a movie trailer and was watching when this movie was released hahaha

I took medicine for All Young hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
This is the first ad I watched to the end this year hahahahahahahahaha
When I worked for All Young, there were a lot of discounts such as All Young Sale, All Young Day, seasonal discount, additional discount, Brand Week, End discount, etc.
Saying you only get discounts every month while working
It's hard for me, but I'm proud of myself when customers ask me how cheap it is🥲
No, why are you being so serious about the All Young advertisement?
I'm going to make a spectacle of money this time for the All Young Sale~
Why are All Young commercials so grand every day hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha It's not a crime to fall for the All Young Sale hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I keep looking at it without thinking hahahaha
I thought I was watching a movie haha ​​It's a parody, the last one is the most powerful hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Actor is immersed
I thought I was watching a movie, but it was a real parody ㅋㅋ The last one is the funniest
What was it at first? I fell in love with it without realizing it hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
What is this sense of urgency in the advertisement??? Hahahaha cool
Ah, I really like this kind of ad hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Jeon Jong-seo appears in Olive Young commercials ㅠㅠ
Olyoung is a real ssap luxury actor, take care of my Jongseo unnie Fay
I love you sister
I thought the movie was good!! Actor Jeon Jong-seo is full of charm!!!

Jeon Jong-seo has a bright future
Why is Jeon Jong-seo written like this ㅠㅠ Who is the advertising planner?

The Chaser parody is a bit Eva, isn't it? Do you not think about the families who were harmed by Yoo Young-chul??? Olive young crazy.
I love you Jeon
Doo-to-do-do
I love you
what more video
=========End of Crawling===========
Anyway, these days summer is coming and I have a lot of trouble with skin exfoliation TT, but how do I know... I didn't know that Olive Young has so many good skin care products. .he
As summer approaches, I think I need to take care of my feet more carefully.
And the foot shampoo is so comfortable. At first, I was bored so I bought and used 4 bottles already? Even my younger brother, who doesn't usually wash well, washes her hands and feet as soon as she comes home after buying it!!
It's summer soon, so I was worried about the dead skin cells on my feet because I thought of wearing sandals and shorts, but it's from All Alain Guide! You posted a timely introduction of dead skin care products for your feet. It's good to see honest reviews, but you're too honest to be honest.
Wow, I thought you would recommend a similar item for exfoliating your feet!! There are various kinds of recommendations, so I really want to buy it ㅋㅋㅋㅋ From tools that even beginners can easily do to the last deodorant!!!
I like these vivid real reviews ㅋㅋ I am amazed at the sacrifice of the guests.... It's hard to test in a store, but it's really nice to see it on YouTube :D
I usually had a lot of trouble with the exfoliation and smell of feet, but after winning the event, I want to experience Olive Young's foot.honey.tem. I want to recommend it to my friends.
Olive young is great haha ​​I don't know how you select and introduce these honey items every time. There are so many different types of foot items. It's only a few days left to wear sandals.
The crocodile foot pack is so amazing. It doesn't seem to work right away, isn't it painful?
I feel like I'm being pushed back, but my feet feel clean this time, Byeol & Tam's chemistry is the best
I'm a bit drawn to physical peeling haha. It's so new to hear that there is a separate shampoo for your feet!! In summer, as soon as you come home, wash your feet quickly and go into your room.
When I think about foot care products, I only knew about dead skin care products, but it’s so good to know now that Olive Young has a variety of products such as foot shampoo and foot deodorant!!
I love you olive
As someone who has used the pack,,,,,
It's absolutely not allowed to take off your socks outside for a week ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ It's a shortcut to becoming a very dirty person.
Still, it's definitely nice that it's soft like a baby's feet. It's worth doing at least once every 3 months!! Especially since it's summer, it's a must-have item before it gets too hot.
I love the foot shampoo!!! My feet feel fragrant and it's so easy to use! I've never tried a crocodile foot pack because I have bad skin on my feet, but this is a review that makes me want to try it!!
Anyway, I've been wearing sandals lately, so my feet have become hardened, but I'm sure there will be new items like this! very good
When it comes to summer, when I wear sandals and slippers, I really care about my heels! When the sales of dead skin care products increase, you feel like summer is coming now ㅋㅋ It's funny? So what the hell was I doing in the first place? I remember doing it! Seeing that there are more than 1000 reviews at Olive Young online mall, it seems that they are still in good health. I used this and thought they became Hansel and Gretel ㅋㅋ It's really naked to go around picking up dead skin cells. I thought it was built, but I think the creativity is great because it made the dead skin cells that are thick like a crocodile's shell soft.
Still, I have to wear sandals these days, so I'm very nervous about my feet!! Exfoliate my skin, wash my feet with shampoo, and the foot deodorant is so good I spray it on before work and even after work! I'm wearing clogged shoes while working, so I'm drenched in odor and sweat.
The foot shampoo is a product that I have used several times. It really removes the smell and is comfortable. I will try other foot care items with this video. The spray seems to be very effective!!!
I've never used a foot care product before, but I love on-the-body foot shampoo!!! I wear sandals every day in the summer, but I think it's a good product to use right now!! thanks for the recommendation
Every time I see the All Young Guide, I come in with a smile hahahaha As soon as I turn on the video, the honey chemistry is great :) Everyone seems to be very friendly haha
I feel it all the time, but it's so good that the video was uploaded just in time for the season and when I was interested.
The foot exfoliant is for a peeling style~ It feels as if all the dead skin cells on my feet have melted away.
Personally, I really want to try a foot shampoo. It smells fresh and I think it's really good.
I'm a little unfamiliar with foot care, but I enjoyed it thanks to All Young.
Wow, I need to buy a foot exfoliation care and a foot shampoo. I haven't tried it so I'm more curious~
There is an Olive Young store near my house.

First of all, I have to go and buy the foot deodorant right away. It seems like a good product.
I didn't know there were so many exfoliating skin care products.
In the past, only in the dry winter, the heel was chaos...
These days, even in spring, there are many good products for suffering from dead skin cells.
There are so many amazing products!! I had fun watching it. I think it would be good as a filial piety item!!
I hate being stuffy, so I don't wear socks, but maybe that's why my heels are a mess.. It's embarrassing to wear sandals in the summer.. There are so many good things about Olive Young.
Wow, these are really cool items that I want to give to my parents! Every time I see Mom and Dad's feet, I feel so upset.
I didn't know there was a good item ㅁ I'm satisfied with just applying Vaseline.
I am the only person who has used all of the Top 5 foot care

... So many dead skin cells on my body... It was really shocking and terrifying lol
You really should wear sandals and slippers in the summer! But really, what about my heels? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha been a lot of foot care products, but I'm very interested in exfoliating because I'm rich in dead skin cells hehe but Tam-nim removes dead skin cells in summer all year round and uses moisturizing products in winter to manage it. You're taking care of it even more than me, it's great! Now, as everyone is preparing for summer, the sales of dead skin care products must have gone up a lot! Haha But the crocodile foot pack is really popular. I think it's really cool! Haha But I'm really curious that the reviews are naked haha ​​It's Hansel and Gretel ㅋㅋ It wasn't really planned, but I'll have to go to the All Young site and see the reviews! Also, the size was bigger than I thought, so I thought liquid would come out too, but I'm glad it didn't flow! I really want to try it because it is cool when I first put it on and it gets hot later!
As someone who wears stockings every day and can't wear sandal slippers because of dead skin on his heels, this video is truly the best of all time.
It's on sale right now, but it looks like you're wasting money on foot care; In the meantime, especially byeol-nim, he pointed out the points carefully, but a little bit of home shopping material.
George Bush every day, and All Alain is George Bush..?
I also bought a crocodile foot pack last week to slowly wear sandals, but the dead skin cells fell off for 5 days and the effect was really good!!! This time, during the all-young sale period, I got it completely!!!
My mom's heels are cracking every day ㅠㅠ I bought a scrub from Daiso and took good care of it, but when I turn around, it cracks again ㅠㅠ Even if I tear it off every day, it comes back to life.. It's even so bad that it bleeds ㅠㅡㅠ
I think I didn't do well because I had to spend on foot management every time.. I hope you win and see the effect!!
I think this would be a good gift for mom and dad.
I was worried about dead skin cells on my feet, but thank you All Alain ️ I will have to stock them during this sale ️ Thank you All Alain
Olan Guide
The keratin pack really peels off the dead skin cells well.. But it takes quite a while because it peels off over time. But it's still so much fun to tear off!
If you really use Olive Young foot care products, you will know.
It feels like my feet are being reborn.
What have you been doing without exfoliating? I can think of it.
I've used it once before, but after using it, I hardly ever get dead skin on my feet, so it's the best all-young product I can remember.
Tomorrow I will go to Olive Young to buy a product and prepare to exfoliate the summer skin~!
Last year, I used the No. 1 Crocodile Foot Pack, and I wondered if there were so many dead skin cells... Haha I'm going to try using it with my husband to get rid of dead skin cells this year! I will not miss this opportunity until the olive sale is just in time.
Awesome great!! haha
I left a comment saying that I really liked dental care and stuff like that!!
You are also uploading foot care!! as well
I want to try the crocodile foot pack, but it looks like I won't be able to take my socks off for a week...
I once bought a crocodile foot pack for my mom, and the effect was so good that I thought I'd give it a try, but I thought it would work.
I think it would be perfect if I spray it, push it with a foot file, and finish it off with shampoo hahahahaha
Haha, these are the products I want to give to my father.
Wow, I was surprised to see the Jinjaru thumbnail, so I came back and forth!
I don't know if it's because I've been exercising since I was little, but I'm not pretty because I have a lot of dead skin cells and calluses on my feet.
I'm going to buy some on the way to Olive Young today!!
I love you Olive Young
I saw the foot care thumbnail and came in saying this is going to be funny hahaha The olin guide is so funny haha
2:57 lol lol lol how do you know? Are you wearing stockings?? I want to buy a titania sandfoot file for my dad!! I really want to try the foot shampoo!
Grapefruit mint, lemon mint, it's really refreshing when your feet smell so good hehehe Byeol-i Manager, this video is really funny hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I really want to try the foot exfoliant too~ There are so many foot care products. Until the day when your feet smell like flowers~~
The crocodile foot pack not only removes dead skin cells, but also removes the skin on the back of the feet.
It's really summer, but still, I was going out a while ago in mules and I was worried about the heel... so I just went out wearing sneakers, but this is truly the best of all time.... The timing is very,,,, great... Sandals If you want to wear them comfortably, you need to take care of your feet!!
No, I was still worried about dead skin on my feet ㅠㅜㅜ I'll watch the video and refer to it
Wow, this is the first time I've seen a product that removes dead skin cells well haha ​​It's really great.. Should I buy it??
All Young Monde Young ㅠㅠ Since there are so many events, I can't help myself!! My mom really has a lot of dead skin cells, so if you win this event and give it to your mom, I think she will really like it. Today's video is really funny. You've really struggled with dead skin cells, so I want to try filial piety. ! If I win, I will cheer for you while watching the All Young video with smooth legs!! Have a good look at the video
And it's a great product for exfoliating heels!!! I think it's good to not only exfoliate but also moisturize and nourish! I think it's really good for a gift to my parents!!! They show dead skin cells in the middle and tell me what you experienced, so I think you can really trust and use them!!! Thanks for giving me such good information!!!
Products that I really want to give to my parents... My parents say that their heels are cracking as they get older, but they are thinking a lot about buying them ㅠㅠ I love you Olive Young.
Foot care products ㅠㅠ Really
I've been waiting in my heart, but I'm sure you'll upload it like this ️
I love you Olive Young..
From hair removal to keratin this time, the video is very helpful thank you
Tam and Byeol-nim's chemistry is no joke hahaha I'm running to All Young tomorrow!!!
Among those of you who see this.. if you have really severe calluses and you have severe calluses, then everything there is useless.
Since I got my feet taken care of, I have calluses, but a lot of calluses have completely disappeared.. Totally baby feet.
but slick? It's like dead skin cells and the itchiness is reduced by half.. It's about 100,000 won for a single dose.. It's expensive, but it's worth doing. One to three treatments is enough hehe Even if you only take it once, only pigs are less effective.. That's why I'm going to try the exfoliating pack.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Can I use this for my dad's age?
My feet look too rough, so I'm going to buy one.
1:51 As a person who uses the crocodile foot pack once a month, I think my feet are the best... It's good for when you're in a hurry! I'm going to buy it!
Please also upload a blackhead recommendation video. If it is already uploaded, please leave a comment! I will run...
I think PD Kim and PD Kwon are so cute and have a good chemistry.
I really like the foot deodorant hahahaha I spray it on before I go out
I saw the email late, so I replied 1 day after the reply deadline, but was the winner canceled? These are the products I really wanted to have ㅠㅠ Can't you just give me one chance..?
Ah.. Please upload the video a bit sooner.... I went to Olive Young earlier.. I'll have to go again tomorrow hahaha
Will you give me an all-alin guide for deodorant for summer??
Heck, I only knew about the file and the foot shampoo, but I did not use it, but today's video makes me want to buy it. I really like the video for the rapidly warming weather ️
Star hahahahaha how do you know?? Are you wearing stockings?? But his expression is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo realistic
I'm 10 now.. My feet are like my maternal grandfather.. ㅠㅠ If I stretched out my legs before going to bed, the curtains would get scaly on my feet, and my sister looked at it and saw that it was my older sister,,,,, heh.. ...Even if I apply all kinds of skincare on my feet, the dead skin doesn't die..I really want to make baby feet ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ
1:51 No, what happened to the dead skin cells from the 6th day.. After all, this is the first time I’ve seen a spray-type crocodile foot pack!! It looks so comfortable and easy to peel off, so I absolutely love it ㅠㅜㅜ They also have an Olive Young sale, so I'll run with it.
I use Bikemol exfoliator and it is cheap and works well.
This episode reminds me of my dad's feet covered in dead skin cells.

I bought a foot care product on the Internet because my dad kept leaving the dead skin cells unattended, but I didn't use it at all because it was bothersome, but the expiration date passed and it became a trash can...
Wow, exfoliant~~~ There's really nothing missing. All Alain Guide! I think this is a must for not only summer but all seasons ~~ This time, I get rid of my worries too.
It would be perfect if mom bought it ㅜㅜ
I came in as if possessed by the thumbnail!!! I don't take good care of my feet, but I need to take care of my feet too.
It's summer, so I want my feet to be light, even 1g.
I love the dead skin care products ><
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ This episode is also fun♡
If it's too severe, it won't work.
Haha these products are more needed by my mom than me
It's called keratin athlete's foot...
4:46 It's so sad ㅋ ㅋ ㅋ ㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ KUTTTTTT TTTT haha ​​I can't even imagine that you'll be in charge of it.
I have a job to go to Olive Young soon, so I will definitely pick the crocodile foot pack ️️️️️️
I will take responsibility for the feet of my parents who work for me.
Is there anything you would like to have, Mr. Byul? lol
I'll take one
I have to do it in winter because of dead skin cells...Is the olive young mask all there...This video is over a year old...
Me too ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
4:25 Dance!! Bibi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bi-bibikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk”
4:34 This haha ​​is that woman's legs with thick hair lol
After watching the video, I can't remove the cotton foot dead skin cells.
that
Nyan's foot washing soap. I'm going to press dislike
I have to give it to my father, thank you.
I will wear slippers this year..!
I need to prepare for summer too.
Yes
=========End of Crawling===========
1:20 Anyone who sees it is warmly welcomed hahahahahahaha I really like the sense of synthesizing. They are all pretty palettes, so I looked at them and thought about it for a while every time I went to Olive Young, but in this video, my mates and beauists explained each product so well, I don’t think there will be any problem with palette shopping now :) It's a pick, so it's so pretty and lovely... Each cast member's favorite palette was different, so I got a lot of sales, but Espoir in particular is sooooooooo pretty. What's going on from Espoir's color scheme to sensibility.. The sound of starting and opening the real wallet I can hear you, what should I do if I make up my mind to run a business like this ㅠㅠ I'm a freshman in the 20th class, but I'm stuck at home due to the current situation ㅠㅠ I'll have to go find the beauties after the corona virus is over! I'm really looking forward to the next video as well.
It was my first filming, so I was a little nervous, but thanks to the PDs, I had fun filming in a relaxed atmosphere! Enjoy the video and have a nice day, thank you :)
🙏🏻💚Thanks to Olive Young, I'm so glad that I can compare these pretty palettes in one place without going around too many brands 🧡
As expected, Olive Young ㅠㅠ It doesn't disappoint ㅠㅠ
These days, shadow palettes are coming out so pretty!!
You tell us about Olive Young's popular items and tell us about its strengths, so you can know and buy good products. Thank you very much💜
I love you Olive Young
All the staff did a good job, so I really like watching the video!-!
Is Olive Young a real shadow restaurant? ♥️
All the colors from 1st to 5th are really amazing ㅠㅠ
The desire to buy is booming ,,, 🌿
I'm interested in makeup these days, so while I was looking at makeup related, I came across it on a recommendation, and I think all the shadow palettes are pretty.
Thanks for the good info Olive Young :)
When choosing a shadow palette, I was curious about which shadow palette has a high purchase rate. Thank you for uploading this video. ♥️♥️ The color of the coloring shot is so pretty,,,,,,, as expected, Olive Young is the best ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
'No, why do I keep coming out with only the palettes I wanted to buy!!?' I was thinking that, but it was Olive Young's TOP 5 hahahahahahahahaha
Olive young that captured everyone's taste 👍
Olive Young's top 5 videos are also good, but there are also Beauty East, so I think it would be good to plan content that makes makeovers for subscribers with popular products~~
(Because I am the first person to know about the existence of beauty artists, I hope that many people will know and find them by promoting them more and more~~)
It's even better if you collect and show the shadow palette like this!!
When I run out of cosmetics or makeup accessories, I look at Olive Young first.
The shadow palettes you introduced are all pretty, but if you show me each color, I know better what suits me 🥰
Jeff is Espoir 💛💚
The shadows are crazy.. The colors are very picky TTTT. Are they all products made for spring... It's so dignified and bubbly💞 I'm a guy who paints his eyes with pink gilding hahahaha😻
I was going to buy a palette, but Olive Young showed me the ranking and explained the product very well, so it was very helpful!! Not all products are missing and they are all beautiful!!
Haha I was really waiting
Thank you for showing each and every color!
Even seeing the color development makes me want to buy more hahahaha
I can't skip it because it feels like each one really exudes its own charm.
I think you really put your soul into each of the colors 🥰💕 Thank you for opening Ebeng and everyone involved here, be careful of Corona!! 😷😭😢
To be honest... I can't tell you about Clio's color selection skills...😘
The price is so reasonable compared to the quality, I can't help but love it all the time💜
Brand affinity is also very high..
But all 5 products are so pretty..!!!
All of the Top 5 products are so pretty ㅠㅠ I really want to collect them ㅠㅠ
Everyone who came out is so fun and full of energy hehe I couldn't go out these days, but seeing new color cosmetics coming out, I suddenly had a desire to buy it. It's nice to be able to drive the product, and it's good to know that it's popular because it's popular, so it was great to know that these products are selling well~ I wanted to buy a shadow palette, so I just searched on YouTube and it popped up at the top, so this is it! I came in and watched it. ! It was very helpful for me to color it myself and recommend it 😘😘
How did you pick up only those pretty products?!❤ All the colors are so pretty 💗✨ Peripera's cost-effectiveness is amazing ㅠㅠ❤ The color development is so good and the pearls are so dazzling.....✨💖The Clio palette is really pretty too. ㅠㅠ...👍👍Olive Young wants to run!!! 💗
Every time I go to Olive Young, only popular and pretty cosmetics are gathered, so whenever I go out, I think I buy something one by one ㅠㅠ
Olive Young has everything from beauty to health, so it's fun to watch and it's great to be able to test it!
From Espoir, 3ce, Romn, Peripera, and Clio must be recognized as real palette restaurants🧡❤️
There are frequent sales and if you go during the sampling period,
Seriously ㅠㅠ Espoir and 3C ㅠㅠ It's crazy.. How come there is no color to throw away!! Bright and colorful...
Heh heh .. they're all so pretty ㅠㅠ The real colors are only pretty, so I want to have them. The staff are all pretty too, so seeing them in use makes me want more 🥰
Only the top 5 are really gathered ㅠㅠ
All of the colors are so pretty and the colors are so good.
Please explain because they are Olive Young employees. Please do it so well hahaha It sticks in my ears I think it would be great to make the next video with top 5 lip or cushion instead of shadow.
Espoir Peach Like is really pretty ㅠㅠ In particular, the glitter doesn't flicker and it's so dazzling😭❤
I have Rom & Hagu Peripera, but I have a desire to own other palettes too... The color combination is so pretty😭 The people who filmed it were so delightful that even me watching it made me feel happy!
Also Olive Young!! I went to Olive Young a while ago, but when I went to Olive Young, I was full and all the shadow palettes were so pretty❤️❤️ Have a good look at the video
After all, as a professional beauty professional, you are quick to talk about various brand products..
How can Olive Young have only pretty products, 💜
Even if I had to pick just one from 1st to 5th, I want them to look so pretty!
The color is pretty and the glitter is bright.
Thank you for always preparing and making great videos haha💝
Looking at the reviews of the best items from the staff of Steamed Olive Young, I was so happy all the time?!🤩

Besides, the tension of each and every employee was so good, I really enjoyed watching it the whole time!
I can't believe it ㅠㅠ It's a shadow palette... ㅠㅠ I'm a fan of palettes ㅠㅠ Every time I visit Olive Young, I buy metallurgy one by one. I was surprised at the kindness of showing so many brands and letting them know the rankings among them...!!! Olive Young, take my paycheck!!!!!!!!!💚💛💛
I've always wanted to try the shadow palette ㅠㅠ Olive Young's mask looks pretty and I didn't know what's popular, but I think it's the best for introductory content like this ㅠㅠ
I'm just looking for it because I've used up all of my existing shadow palettes. Thank you so much for this video ㅠㅠ❤️❤️ I'll look for pretty shadow palettes by referring to the video//
Haha, I first thought that there was an official channel for All Young, but it's a palette recommendation video!!!!! Isn't the content so good?!?!?! Olive Young is a brand that I love because it has the best accessibility among the real drug stores and there are many benefits and events. I want to see the online brand cosmetics that are in Olive Young!! (And the staff unnies who appeared are all charming 🥰)
Espoir Real Eye Palette is so pretty that I personally wanted to have it ㅜㅜ The colors are so crazy!!
There is no color to throw away all the shadow palettes these days!!
Since you explain with many palettes, I think you can easily find out which palette suits you better!!
It's cumbersome to carry all the shading blush and shadows, but Espoir really did a great job, it's blended into the most beautiful colors ever ㅠㅠ It looks so pretty❤
Wow, there is no such thing as a really ugly color, Jone ㅠㅠ♡
Thanks to this Olive Young, I'm going to have to wear a palette again TTㅠ Really Olive Young I live thanks to you There is only one cosmetics store, so I love it more ㅠㅠ Please love our Olive Young a lot ㅜㅜ
Anyway, top 5 products on my wish list!!! All of the palettes are so pretty and I don't think there is anything missing from practicality and collectible value! Among them, Espoir is full of fun mood, so I want to have all three colors 💦 I'll have to re-apply the No. 1 colors at Olive Young 😖❤
Oh wow, that brilliance that makes you fall in love as soon as you see it...❤ The light from the shadow is dazzling, so how the heck did you film it... I really miss Olive Young, I respect you beyond love❤❤❤❤ I just don't look at Olive Young products anymore I just bought it, and it goes well today too ❤❤❤❤ Please, I hope you win this event. It's natural, so anything suits you. Send me anything.....
It's really pretty and the case is simple, so I really like it If you would like it to be a top 5 pack that sells and has many recommendations ;;
As summer mutes, Romanne and Peripera are the ones I'm most attracted to.. ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° Everyone's sales power is what..
Thoughts are rushing
Shadow is really a no-brainer ㅠㅠㅜㅜ
The color is crazy ㅠㅠTT In particular, the glitter is so pretty.
I really wanted the Clio eye palette, but this time I got it and I'm so excited ㅠㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜㅜ❤
Olive young is really cool ㅠ Please upload more good videos in the future❤❤
Thank you so much for the event.
I really like that you give a good review❤️❤️
You may be working right now, but always stay healthy❤️ And I think all the staff members give good reviews. I hope you get subscribers quickly❤️🧡💛
Oh, what, the content is good and the data is based on the actual purchase rate that only Olive Young can do, so trust is building up... All the beauties are so cute!!!! Subscribe
Wow TTTT I really missed the top 5 eyeshadow palette !!😍 I watched the video diligently✨💞 If you are the people who uploaded all the products there, no one will know!!
The color is so pretty and how pretty...🌷
I tried the Espoir Shadow Palette, but it looks like a real board 🙊Rom&Doo ㅠㅜㅜ💖 The color of the Clio palette is not good.. ㅠTT Pearl Dappak❤
Have fun watching the video today too!!!😍🙏✨
ROM&amp;n’s really perfect as a daily shadow and it’s so small that it fits in a pouch and I love it❤💕
The shadow palette is a real desire to possess, but for me as a student, it is too expensive, haha ​​I was still thinking about buying a palette, but Allyoung organized it like this Thank you hehe But they are all so pretty,,
The person who waited for Shadow is me. When I buy shadows, I prefer palette products that are easy to combine colors rather than single items! All of the palettes in the Top 5 have good color combinations, and they come out as shadows that can be used for both daily makeup and colorful makeup! Besides, the palette that I used and used came out in the top 5, so I have more confidence and think I should buy that palette next time!!

In particular, the palette I am most looking forward to is the top 1 main character, Clio Pro Eye Palette!! Clio is famous for choosing colors well! There are different types of matte, shimmer, and pearl, and I am very curious about the feeling of using crystal glitter, which is not easily found in Korean shadow palettes. I think it will look very pretty if you tap it over your eyelids with your finger.
Uni!! At the Seohyun store, I got a personal color diagnosis from Uni-nim, and he was so kind and humorous ㅠㅠ I remember laughing the whole time with my friends hehe! I was so surprised when I saw the advertisement that I searched the video like this and found it lol You were so kind and professional, Uni-nim 😊! The Bobbi Brown lip and tint of a similar color that you recommended back then were all purchased from Olive Young and I am using them really well 💕💕!! Even though it was a free diagnosis, I was surprised that he did so well. Please be kind to Olive Young Uni-nim ><><!!
I ordered a palette a while ago ㅠㅠ In the end, it's selling very well ㅠㅠ Unnies are great haha ​​♥️♥️
3ce actually picks up pretty lip colors, but the shadows are pretty too.
Full of my favorite colors.
And Clio too, I want to buy it when I use up everything I have at home.
I think all the olive young shadow palettes are pretty~
When it comes to olive young, it's the shadow palette!
When the new shadow palette comes out, it's almost like running straight to Olive Young to buy it🏃‍♀️
Especially the Espoir palette, which is ranked 3rd among the shadow palettes in this video, is really pretty!
It's very helpful because only the facts are included😍 There are no real shadows that aren't pretty, but among them, Jelu Jelu ❤❤ If you bring pretty things, my eyes will be very happy.
It was the first time I saw the video to see if there was such a thing as a beautician! I just found out that skin measurement, personal color diagnosis, and makeup services are also available at Olive Young.
And when the new palette comes out, I can relate to the fact that the Olive Young employees also like it a lot! hehe
The 5th place, rom&n, is a product that has been seen everywhere since the milk series came out for the first time, so it is a product that I have a strong desire to purchase! It has a soft texture like a baby's butt hehe I want to try more!
The rom & lavender color is really pretty. No ㅠㅠ I really like this color, but I didn't know there was any uniqueness in it ㅠㅠ Ha, it's great. One Olive Young review is really neat and cool ㅠㅠ
Espoir Real Eye Palette TTTTTT The top left glitter is a really moist shiny glitter ㅜㅜ It's a pity I couldn't read the description of the color.
The staff unnies put it on their own eyes and they are so pretty!!
I went to Olive Young and it would be amazing to see the unnies in the video... lol
All the babies I wanted to buy are in the Top 5.. ㅠㅠ I haven't bought them all, but I think the real value for money bag is Espoir.
I ran as soon as the alarm went off 😍

I was really thinking and thinking about what to buy to get a new shadow palette this time, but you just uploaded a video 😭😘 Thank you ♥ 3ce palette, Clio Really makes me want to buy 😍+Espoor haha ​​I really need to run Olive Young! The explanation is also really awkward to ask at the store, and I have a personality that asks the wrong thing, so it was difficult every time I purchase it, but I always refer to it and watch it carefully through Olive Young channel! I already watched the video and bought the hand sanitizer and gargle that you recommended last time! I always support you and watch your videos ☺️☺️😍♥️
Peripara Ink Pocket Shadow Palette
I really do too ㅠㅠ I use it so well, I bought another one and am using it... I bought rom & shadow a while ago and it feels like I'm really short...🥰
It's 5 minutes from our house... It's easy to go shopping.
I love it so much.. I only walk on the flower road
But the real Espoir palette looks like a real box of color 👍
From 1st to 5th in the shadow palette, they are all so pretty 💕 I like the rom and better than eyes shadow as a cool tone. I think I'm going to watch this video as well! I'm looking forward to good videos from now on~!💚
After all...they're all hot products! The shadow palette Sado also has a desire to buy it again, and I'm proud that I have 2 of the Top 5.
Be sure to buy the real rom & palette ㅠㅠ You don't need a brush and the color comes out even if you apply it with your hands ㅠㅠ I love dried mango tulips because I'm a brown worm ㅠㅠ
Hot.. As expected, Olive Young's new palette is right away, and during a period when I can't go out like these days, if I compare it with a video like this, my wallet won't open and I can't open it. New discovery!! Ah, I guess mother-of-pearl glitter like Clio is trendy these days. It's a young boss... 3ce is also very good 💗💗💗 It's fun to take a look at new cosmetics every time I go there, but I can't go out these days. !🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️
As expected, I thought the Clio Pro Eye Palette would take first place 👍🏻
By the way, the color and package are as pretty as the first place, such as rom&better than eyes, 3CE multi eye color palette, and Espoir real eye palette. It makes me want to spend money hahahaha
All of the eyeshadows were dug out, so I needed a shadow... It's like such a clever All-Young!!! Awesome you guys...
Wow, I bought the brown shoes yesterday and I am regretting something, but seeing this, I feel like I bought it perfectly.
It's my first filming and it's really good! Haha I don't think it's possible, but humans have to challenge it 😻
The color combination is so beautiful and the cool tone one-tone is perfect.. The shadow palette that seems to be useful in all seasons is so pretty that I’m thinking about which one to buy!!

I was diagnosed with a personal color and received makeup service from those beauticians. They were so kind and nice😍 I always thought I was a warm autumn tone, but thanks to the beauty artists, I knew I was a fall mute tone that needed a yellow tint. I bought it because it was in business hahahaha After all, isn't it true that Olive Young comes out thick with both hands once you enter it 🌟🌟
I like the palette so much that it makes my heart flutter ㅠㅠ I'm happy...
2:19 She's really pretty....Suddenly, the atmosphere is goddess.. ㅠㅠ It's sold out💘
Wow . Among cosmetics, the one I like the most and keep an eye on is the shadow palette.
I was very curious about what kind of products the top 5 shadow palettes in Olive Young would be, but you uploaded them in a video like this ㅜㅜ You introduced each product one by one, showed me color shots, and gave detailed information about the contents inside. A lot of my favorite brands are in the top 5.
Among the palettes in the video, I
I'm still thinking of buying a palette.
It helped me to think about All Young's popularity rankings!!! It seems like this is the palette I have all of them😍 Subscribe and Like~❤
After all, my favorite Clio is number one! It's like a clio hehehe There are so many other products I want to buy too, but the mates who explain it are so cute😭💗 Thanks to you, the product is being sold,, gun gun,,,
Wow...👍 Clio Palette is so pretty I want it! I hope I won >_< I ran to see Sean's, but it's so cute🤪❤
I love you, Olive Young...❤ There are really few things that you can't really get out of when you go in❤❤ Olive Young 🥰☺️
There are all of them except S-Poir, but the lines recommended over there are really above average..❤️❤️
Why are the shadows so pretty~~~ I'm too lazy to put on makeup as I get older, so I only do the fact and lip and then...
The shadows come out really well these days, all of them are so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I'm also using the Clio Pro Eye Palette, but I really like it. I hope everyone buys it. You look good ㅜㅜ❤ I have to buy all 3rd place for Espoir... Good luck with the All-Alain Guide today
I saw it, thank you for ten days 💚
I have one of all three rom&3ce clios hahaha It's fun to see them come out like this again
Hey, there's one palette over there, a friend sent me a gift, so it's very useful ㅠㅠ❤
You're so pretty ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I want to have it!!
It's worth it. I've been waiting for a real shadow palette... No, why do everyone pick colors so well? I think the shadow palette is really well made by Clio 😭😭 !!Young Long Boss!!
Hot palette hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Crazy TTTT It's so pretty, but if you buy them all, there are a few problem books for the money.. TTTT The cost-effectiveness is good, but sometimes it's expensive to buy for makeup.
Still, Olive Young has a lot of brands that I like, so I go to it most often.
I'm running out of time looking at the shadows in Olive Young's mask ㅠㅠ
Super cute Janayu,,,❤️ Sean's Hyni love love 🥰
Heuk-heuk ㅠㅜ My skin is crying. Usually companies don’t make cool tone palettes for bakes, but I was worried that they didn’t match the cool tones well. I think I was born
It's Sean's ❤️❤️❤️❤️ It's so nice to see you here!!!!!!!! I'm going to go buy rom & it's sold out,,,,,,,
Hahahaha tension love❤️
Heh heh....I also build Tetris with palettes TTTT Huh...Romanne is something I was really considering this time ㅠㅠㅠㅠ I've been wanting to use the 3CE palette for a long time too ㅠㅠ I wanted to try it out because my Espoir friends said it was cheap and good... The palette has everything from shimmer to glitter, so I used it a lot and broke it a while ago... I really wanted the Clio palette to look like a brown shoe, so I was saving money...! I really love you.. Olive Young will be with you forever.
Ah.... I'm really mad
I didn't buy street pastels... Do I have to go and buy them?!
No, the glitter color is wow~~~~
Is there just a way to differentiate between an employee and a beautyist employee?
ROM&N is a glitter restaurant..❤❤
All Young Gold CJ One Vivid Passes by...
All the palettes are so pretty
I really want to win this time.
Same product as I thought!! After all, pretty things must be popular, especially 3ce ㅠㅠ She's really pretty ㅠㅠ
Please give milk series shadows to Olive Young offline too.❤
I was still thinking about buying a palette, but the female video was helpful!!
3:17 Thank you so much😻
It's so much fun to see more and more diverse staff and mates in the All Alain Guide. 🤭🤭 It's becoming more popular, so I'm proud of myself as an existing subscriber!! Olive young YouTube restaurant Gazua➰ 💃🏻♥️
Olive Young, Korea's leading drug store!
All Alain Guide consists of only proven products with high user preference based on sales performance, so I think it will be very helpful to make a purchase without regret ♡
Personal color and makeup service? Olive young is also...❤
And last time, I felt it in the top 5 video of Olive Young's new product, but I think it's so much fun that the editor took medicine and edited Olive Young!
I came to look at cosmetics and the video itself was so fun and I laughed a lot thanks to the beauticians' witty words! I liked it more because it felt like I was looking at the product and talking with my friends😍😍
And it was so much fun to watch Sean's get angry at 2:15 to buy it hahaha
I searched YouTube to buy a shadow palette, but I saw it because it was the most popular. The price and the color development in the reviews are so good, so I'm already thinking about what to say ㅜㅜ I think the event with such a good review is so good ㅜㅜ It's a real legend. This is my first time on this Hyeja channel. ..ㅜㅜ The weather is getting warmer, these are the perfect palettes for this kind of weather. It's cool 💗
Can you give me the top 5 as a blackhead product for the next video ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
Rom&Dried Buckwheat Flower is really good, but even without makeup, it's like the shade on your eyes, so it feels like it's getting thicker....
1:20 Cool tone users cry ㅠㅠ😍
Oh really, what is Olive Young ㅠㅠ It's the only thing I like ㅠㅠ It's so pretty I'm going crazy ㅠㅠ I went to buy it because I didn't have the money, but I really want to get it ㅠㅠ I love Olive Young ❣❣❣❣
You brought all the good eye palettes... Just looking at them makes me feel better... I still don't use much eyeshadow because I'm a self-proclaimed snot sprout, and I don't know what to use. I think anyone can use it well because they are with each other!
All of the shadow palettes introduced today were the palettes I was interested in, and they are very nice to introduce them!
It's really all so respectful.
Everything is too expensive....😭😭😭😭❤️
It's a burden for me,,,,,, the price of 2 problem books ㅠㅜ
I think it's useful for beginners who don't know much about cosmetics but are hesitant in choosing them.
The Clio Palette is also ranked No. 1.....! I wasn't the only one who liked it😭👍 First of all, the glitter is really pretty.... Oh right, next time, please recommend a delicious snack (?) for olive oil!!❤
Hell Olive Young also sells Rom & Better Than Eyes?? Thank you ㅠㅠ I love you Olive Young❤❤❤❤❤
Huh.. all the palettes seem to have chosen the colors very well!!
I've been hesitating to buy a shadow palette these days, but thanks to Olive Young's mates and beauticians, my worries have eased a bit❤️ It's a pity I can't see beauticians near where I live.. Still, it's really nice to be able to get recommendations through video💘 3CE is a brand that has shaken my heart for a long time, but I thought it would also be in the rankings.. Haha. I heard that Espoir's reaction was really hot this time, but the case is also something different... Besides, there are a lot of palettes these days, but there are too many glitters, so it's a little too much for me. It's a burden😭 The composition of matte, shimmer, and glitter is my favorite, so I want to go to the store and test it right now!!! Even the detailed color shots were very helpful. I enjoyed the video 💜
These days, there are so many shadow palettes that I had a lot of trouble deciding which one to buy, but I'm so grateful that they all organized it at a glance 😆😆😆😆🌸🌸
It's a cool winter tone, but I always hate to use a pink palette TTTT I want to do shade makeup, but the colors are so warm that it doesn't suit me,, TT I miss the video so much I want to have rom'n's TTTT So those who put on makeup with rom'n palette You're pretty TTTTTT you really have a great atmosphere!!
3ce was crazy...that was a real uproar...there's no one who hasn't tried it in the midst of 3ce, so I'm not sure about the shock....I love overtakes. I love warm tones. It's a glitter restaurant!!!!
Ha I came in 30 minutes!! Everyone is so pretty!! There was also a pretty unnie I met for the first time, but I fell in love with it ㅡㅜㅜ I'll look forward to it
I have the Peripera Sagu Palette No. 4, and I really like the bright and soft colors of Nos. 1 and 2.
I use Olive Young often, but it's a bit far from my house, so it's difficult to go there, especially these days.
So, from now on, I enjoy shopping with the Olive Young app.
I want to go to the Olive Young store and test it myself.
It's crazy, so pretty, I want it ㅜㅜ
When I went to All Young, I bought basic products, color products, hair products, etc. while looking at them like I was bewitched, but this is a color restaurant in particular. I'm going to come again soon,,, ha
I think it would be really good to use with the Espoir Real Eye Palette.
Shading is possible and blush is also possible, it is really the best!!❤
After becoming my first office worker and working in a business department, I tend to wear calm makeup on weekdays, so I gradually omit the shadows and choose to sleep. On the weekends, I really want to put on pretty makeup, take a selfie at home, and pretend I’m out on a picnic hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha~ If I go out with pretty shadows and go out with a boyfriend, I’ll upload a tribute video for Olive Young ( Real) Espoir, I must visit the Olive Young store soon to test it out and get it!!!! If it’s the next content you want to see, I’ll look forward to the best match between Fixer and Primer Glow/Met Lip Ampoule Heehee❣️
I saw this and was going to buy one, but I liked them all so I couldn't pick just one.
I love olive young so much~~I can't stop branding it~~♥
Olive young products are very rare, but my favorite dry color~~ Please tell me the palette ranking like this~ Good brands don’t disappoint~~
I was blown away when I saw it, but at 4:06 the number one product has already appeared hahahahahahahaha
It's really fun today, and I've been trying to buy a shadow palette these days, but I'm going to pick one out of this video and live it haha
I want to give this to my mom personally! haha
I was writing 3C and my sister stole my sister's Clio, but both are so pretty!
Oh my god I love this kind of video❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I want to buy them all ㅠㅠㅠㅠ
Oh, I really love Olive Young. I really, really, really want all 5 palettes, but I really love 3ce Rom & Espoir Peripera Clio. I thought it was the same, but it was because of the price 3ce is really pretty. I knew Clio would be number one. Clio is so awesome. The quality is really good compared to the price. ... I will write a lot, I love you
I was looking for a shadow palette right now, so this is useful information 🙂 In fact, I didn’t know what to buy when I went to Olive Young, so wow

I was confused, but I need to buy the best item recommended by Olive Young and try it 😄😄
Olyoung is like a sparrow's mill, a place you can't just pass by ㅜㅜ♡
Her younger brother moved and the eyeshadow compartment was empty, but besides, I have a cool tone ... Doo Doong .. I compare them every day when I go to All Young and I become holy so I can't come out right away.... ㅜㅜ ♡
I really want the palette ㅜㅜ
I was thinking about which one would be better to purchase ㅜㅜ You uploaded a good video!!! thank you 👍
There are various brands in Olive Young, so it was always good to test them out, but there were so many pretty girls, I had a lot of trouble deciding what to buy. Especially the eye palette! Romn, 3CE, Espoir, Peripera, and Clio in the top 5 in the video, including Raka and Wakemake that I am interested in, are all so pretty that it was hard to decide which one suits the tone. Pearl-oriented, beginners, various looks preference) + I think it was so good to know the recommended tone❤ I can't go all year long due to social distancing, but I'll have to go get a palette soon!
It's not a shadow palette ranking, it's a dabak ㅠㅠ All of them from ROM& to 3CE Clio are so pretty. Among them, the Discovery Pig palette and the Clio gold palette are the same, so they're pretty ㅠㅠ It's a great boss. ... You did a really good job of coloring your wrist, and I'm so glad you know it well ㅠㅠ How do you know that I like flashy skins and admire them again, and they're so pretty...? I've been looking for cool tone shadows lately, but I'm going to participate in an event and see them. The shadows are really bright and so pretty. I like the heartbeat. I really like the video.
I really want Espoir... It's hard to create multiple makeups with just one palette, but I think it's good because I only need to take one of those when I go out to play 👍👍
I love Olive Young as usual!! I was just looking for a shadow palette, and I liked the event running subscription.
In general, the truth is that eyeshadows have many colors..!
Peripera Glitter was so rusty that I couldn't use it.
After seeing the advertisement for ROM&N's new shadow, I was craving to buy it, but I also want to buy Espoir and Peripera.
0:17 I didn't know it was possible in Olive Young.
The 5th place is dried buckwheat flowers and the Clioger wants the most..
If there is a very cheap and pretty shadow palette in Olive Young in Busan, please recommend it ㅠㅠ It goes well with cool tones!
Looks like a professional actor hahaha cute
TOP5 are all pretty~❤

I am writing a review because I have one of these products.

ROMN: The particles are as fine as flour, so they feel softly absorbed into the eyelids. Even without a primer, all the oil around the eyes is removed.
Huh, I really want to have them all. I have Rom&N, and the color combination is very pretty and nice ㅠㅠ It’s especially pearlescent, but this is a 5 win, how much better the others are TTTTTT TTTT In particular, Clio is really pretty. Be careful of Corona 💜
They are all famous products, and only the products that are sure to come out are well-known.
Espoir is great for a subtle daily makeup, and it is recommended for travel as one makeup is finished. Each brand has its own points.
I have a 3ce smoother, but I ordered the deer nude because a new color, deer nude, was in stock ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠ It's so pretty ㅠㅠ
Looking at this way, I think there are so many pretty things in the Olive Young palettes ㅠㅠ The color combinations are so good, there are so many colors that look good on a daily basis but also perfect for a point...! From 😭❤️❤️
I'm so envious of stacking Tetris with the palette I have at home. Young😭 I can't even dream of tetris because I only have single shadow 😂 After watching this video, the shadow palette was sold so much, I think I'll try Shadow Tetris too ㅋㅋ As expected, Olive Young's sales skills are very good. I need to know😍😍 It makes my wallet open.. I can't help but go to All Young❤
I was a little worried because the beauticians had reached their recommendation, but I think I'm still very attracted to the original color restaurant, Clio Palette! The Clio Palette is really out of stock nationwide, so it's a product I haven't been able to see before! There must be a reason it took 1st place, right? Let's be so hot~ 😆 In particular, the brilliance of crystal glitter.. Once applied, it looks like a shadow made from gold foil paper. It looks so brilliant haha
It's pretty ㅠㅠ I thought Rom&Clio and Clio were going to be excited.. I've never used them before, but I want to try them ㅠㅠ
I was looking for a shadow palette as a birthday present for a friend, but after watching this video, I found a palette to give as a gift! I personally like it, but since they are products that Olive Young recommends, I have more confidence in them. I'm choosing a gift for a friend, so why am I choosing the one I'm also buying...?? Haha😂 It's pretty when you look at it separately, but when you put it together like this, it's even prettier and brighter.
Anyway, the video helped me a lot in choosing a gift! Thank you so much for collecting these sweet items and making videos and recommending them ❤
Only the Peripera Palette gave me a headache! The color on the top left of No. 1 is the real thing
I think the shadow is the best for Olive Young❤
The color is very pretty, everything is pretty, but I
I think Espoir in 3rd place is the prettiest❤❤
After seeing this video, I want to run to Olive Young right away.
Olive young eyebrow top 5 please!
Heh heh, finally the shadow palette!!!! I've been waiting for a long time..I'm always proud of what I'm writing is in the top 5>< Today it's not...I'm not here..what did you spend your money on..😭 I want to try it out. Next time I buy it, I'll definitely buy one of the five!!! Many kinds = good ones, I will buy Clio!!!!
This time, the Holika Holika 4 palette palette is on sale for 9,900 won, but if you share a shadow recommendation video, I can't help but buy it.
4:25 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
I was thinking about which shadow to buy, but thanks to Olive Young Channel, I can worry less!! 3EC is my style, but it's too expensive for me so I passed..😢
What should I do with Olive Young .... How long will my bankbook be robbed ..... My wallet thief Olive Young ... Why are all those palettes so pretty Tears TTTTTTTTTTTT I felt it when I went to All Young and looked around. I think it's really pretty ㅠㅠ All of my friends around me use it too...! 😭💦✨❤️
It's like magic that makes you want all the TOP5
Peripera Ink Pocket 03 Brown.
Except for the glitter, it's the best ㅜㅜ The particles are too thick
ㅜㅜ I bought this because I brought the wrong money...
Still, it's so pretty for daily use ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
I love you Olive Young ♥
If I ever win, tell my wife
I want to give it to you ♥
Rom&Better than Eyes Dried Mango Tulip Color just go back huh.. it's so pretty ㅜㅜ
If you have a warm tone, I definitely recommend it.
As soon as I put it on and went out, my friend said the shadow was so pretty, so I even sold it.
I'm really new to eye makeup, but I thought the number one palette was really good, so I paid 32,000 won to buy it..
It's a lip product brand that I've used every once in a while, but I've never used eyeshadow before.
The Espoir palette came out really well❤ The design is pretty, and the color and composition are even prettier haha ​​I love Olive Young so I go there a lot, but all of those products are so good❤ There is no yoroke charm that radiates from the YouTube channel...??
Sean's-nim ㅠㅠㅠㅠ Her voice is like Kim Hye-yoon ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ The person who played the role of Ye-seo in scan..!
🌸It was the first time I knew that there was an employee called 'Beautyist'!!!!! It seems like a necessary role oooh🐥 I really wanted all the shadows, so I don't know what to buy 💕 Next time, I want to see the top 10 least popular in Olive Young.
Is it a product sold all at Olive Young?
Is that Clio eye palette still on sale at All Young?
The palette felt kind of expensive, so I bought a single shadow and collected more than 10.... If that's the case, I've just bought a palette and the dirt... The fat pouch is all because of them ㅠㅠ I only carry one palette and it's Cifer U ㅠㅠ
4:13 It's a festival yeah~~~~
Three Mr. Smoother and Clio were debating and I bought the Clio Brown Shoe, but I want to buy the smoother so crazy
Ah...ㅠ I just went because it was the last day of the All Young sale.....
Hey, Wakemake's new palette is pretty and nice too.
Can't you do the top 5 student cosmetics?
I have Clio Coral Talk, but I bought it because it was a warm tone pink palette, but the crystal glitter turned purple, so I can't use the crystal glitter well ㅠㅠ
Olive young
How many gold pearls did you use on the Clio palette?? I can't buy it because I'm confused
No. 1 Shadow sold for 23,000 won on 11th Street It's not a bette, but in fact, please take note..
I want to buy Espoir; not that but all of them
1:30 I saw you on the subway and you thought you were in New York
Ah, I didn't write what I was writing.
But why am I sad?
What the hell...why do my comments keep getting deleted.....
Olive young, stop working part-time.
Part-timers hate those clothes;
I thought it was a masturbation device because of the Dubba mosaic
wow
